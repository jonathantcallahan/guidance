        "output": "In practical terms this experience is one of exhilarating spiritual freedom, amounting almost to the sanctification of ordinary, everyday life. For, when man feels free to be all of himself, there is a magic in every littlest act and thought. Thus the Zen poet, Hokoji, says: How wondrous strange and how miraculous, this\u2014I draw water and I carry fuel."

        "output": "It will now be clear that Shinran\u2019s faith has a right to be considered as philosophic Mahayana expressed in rather colorful, symbolic imagery, even though it appears to be quite dualistic in conception. Philosophic Mahayana would not allow the dualism of self and other, man and Amida; but, if it is followed far enough, Shin arrives in experience at what Mahayana states in philosophy\u2014although complete nonduality is actually beyond philosophic description."

        "output": "Furthermore, the Lankavatara insists that Samsara, the world of life and death, is Nirvana, and Samsara just as it is, with all its pain and suffering. So, too, Shinran insists that we are saved by Amida just as we are, with all our imperfections. In other words, ordinary men are Buddhas just as they are, and, according to Hui-neng, of the Zen school, those whom we call Buddhas are simply those who understand this truth."

When he wants to walk, he walks; when he wants to sit, he sits; He has no hankering after Buddhahood, not the remotest thought of it. How is this possible? A wise man of old days says, if you strive after Buddhahood by any conscious contrivances, your Buddha is indeed the source of eternal transmigration."

Zen does not say so as a rule, because the terms, Nirvana and Buddha, are concepts that do not move the soul deeply and lead easily to mere intellectualism."

        "output": "This freedom is known when we give up \u201ccontriving\u201d and accept ourselves as we are, but it does not seem to me that the experience can be effective unless there has first been a state of contriving and struggle. In Zen this is self-discipline; in Shin it is coming to an acute awareness of one\u2019s insufficiency through a previous attempt at self-discipline. It is difficult to see how the Shin experience could be fully appreciated unless, like Shinran, one had first tried the jiriki way."

Spiritual freedom, however, involves much more than \u201cgo on living exactly as you have lived before.\u201d"

There are no longer any obstacles to thinking and feeling; you may let your mind go in whatever direction it pleases, for all possible directions are acceptable, and you can feel free to abandon yourself to any of them."

        "input": "How do you see the concept of true freedom in life?",
        "output": "In Shin terms, we should say that the meaning of freedom is that you can think any kind of thought, be any kind of person, and do any kind of thing without ever being able to depart from Amida\u2019s all-embracing love and generosity. You are free to do as you like, and also as you don\u2019t like, to be free and to be bound, to be a sage and to be a fool. Nowhere are there any obstructions to spiritual activity."

Because this knowledge can never be written down Zen does not rely on scriptures, even though it may use them as devices. Words cannot convey it, just as they cannot describe colors to a blind man."

        "input": "Why do we often feel like something is missing in life despite having many experiences?",
        "output": "Indian religion has ever been characterized by the quest for \"that One thing, knowing which we shall know all.\" In the Upanishads, this \u201cOne thing\u201d is termed Brahman, the absolute Reality of the universe beyond all opposites. All ordinary things and experiences have opposites; life is opposed to death, pleasure to pain, joy to sorrow, and light to darkness. These opposites are necessary to one another, so that life is always limited by death, and joy by sorrow. But Reality itself has no opposite; it is advaita, nondual, and the soul of man is only delivered from death and sorrow by realizing its identity with Reality."

        "output": "For the Upanishads taught that Brahman is the true nature of ourselves and of all things. Not to realize this is ignorance (avidya) and unhappiness, but to know it is true knowledge (vidya) and a transcendental happiness which is eternal because, strange to say, it too has no opposite. Thus the religion of the Upanishads was more or less monistic, believing that all forms and objects were in fact manifestations of the One Absolute."

But whereas the Upanishads described the nondual Reality as the One, Mahayana felt this term misleading. One is opposed to Many and None, for which reason Reality must transcend even oneness. Mahayana went beyond monism."

        "output": "To say that all things are one is to reduce everything to something which is still short of nonduality, since one-ness has an opposite and so cannot be the Absolute. Furthermore, the very statement, \u201cAll things are Reality,\u201d contains an implied opposition between \u201call things\u201d and \u201cReality.\u201d In making such a statement we are uniting two things which are in no need of union. They are already united, and to try to create the union in thought or in feeling is to imply to oneself that it does not already exist. Nirvana (the sense of Reality) is Samsara (the state of ordinary life) and the very act of trying to realize that they are one implies that they are not."

As the crystal ball reflects images, the manifold universe appears spontaneously within Sunyata. There is nothing in it, but everything comes out of it. Sunyata is the all-inclusive; having no opposite, there is nothing which it excludes or opposes."

Tao is life considered as a flowing power, like the wind, or a stream, or the present moment. It is sometimes rendered as \u201cthe Way of things,\u201d or as the Logos. A person who has realized union with Tao is said to be in a state of Te, or \u201cgrace,\u201d while the method of realization is called Wu-wei (no-assertion)."

But if he can realize that he is one with Tao, the fullness of life, he will cease to want to possess things and will therefore be free from evil. If man ceases from self-assertion and lets go of life, the Tao will have a chance to operate freely within him. His life will be lived not by his own ego, but by Tao."

More particularly, it is the kind of Zen adopted by Westerners studying in Japan, who will before long be bringing it back home. But there is an obvious difference between square Zen and the common-or-garden squareness of the Rotary Club or the Presbyterian Church. It is infinitely more imaginative, sensitive, and interesting."

Thus a living, individual organism is not only part of the world, but it goes with a world of just this nature."

        "output": "Insights of these kinds have been enormously helped by the recognition that in science one speaks, not so much of what things are as of what they do. The world is described as behavior or process, so that what was formerly \u201cthing\u201d is now simply \u201cevent.\u201d One no longer asks what (thing) is behaving in such-and-such a way; one simply describes the behavior and says where it is happening. In other words, action does not have to be ascribed to an agent defined as something quite different from action. The agent, too, can be sufficiently described as action."

The method is essentially a dialogue between a Buddha, a person who is awakened to his real identity, and an ordinary individual, who experiences himself as a separate being. The dialogue begins when the latter raises a question, which may be as radical and simple as how to escape from suffering."

        "output": "At this point he has no alternative but to let go, or rather, a letting go comes about through the whole of his being, since it is an action no longer attributed to the ego as agent. He is, as it were, thrown into sunyata like a person falling, for the first time, into water, into the ocean of relativity.

He can thus devote himself wholeheartedly to his work in the simple faith that God is as much with him when he is not specifically thinking about God as when he is. "

In purifying our knowledge of God we come to the point where He seems, to all knowledge and sense, to have forsaken us utterly. For we have purified that knowledge of every attempt to grasp God in sensible and intellectual forms, so that there is nothing left to know in any ordinary sense of the word, save what may be known by simple faith in the truths that God has revealed about Himself."

The work of contemplation may also attract those who wish to pride themselves upon their spiritual superiority, since mystical writers are accustomed to speak of it as a \u201chigh\u201d and \u201csublime\u201d type of prayer.

It is a work because it requires a much greater degree of concentration, for the will has to leave behind the convenient props of verbal prayer and discursive meditation, and direct itself into the divine darkness with a single act of love and faith."

For if we say that the human soul has the four faculties of sensation, intellect, feeling and will, vocal prayer, in which we use the sensible forms of definite words or such external aids as the rosary, is prayer through the faculty of sensation. This is usually the easiest form of prayer for the beginner."

        "output": "Next we rise to mental prayer, or discursive meditation, which is prayer through the faculty of the intellect, in which we ponder various divine truths or images in the thinking mind. Following this, the faculty of feeling comes into play as affective prayer, in which we feel about those truths rather than think about them. Instead of thinking love toward God, we feel love toward Him, and this feeling may express itself in short ejaculatory sentences or phrases of adoration and praise."

For the will is the central and all-determining faculty of the soul, and in contemplative prayer we simply will toward God. "

The term \u201cprayer of quiet\u201d refers to the quiescence of the sensations, thoughts and feelings, but the term \u201csimple regard\u201d refers to an intense activity in that center of consciousness, which underlies these three faculties."

Activity ceases only in regard to the movement of the beam, but not in regard to the intensity of light.

The realization of our absolute dependence upon God is perhaps the most helpful factor in abandoning our lives to His will, for it tells us that we have nothing to lose save a purely imaginary self-sufficiency.

To know God by unknowing is to surrender the mind entirely to God instead of trying to possess God as a concept of the mind or an object of knowledge. The mind knows God by unknowing in the same way that the soul is saved by losing itself. To abandon the mind to the Void of the \u201cdivine darkness\u201d in the loving faith that God is there is the equivalent of abandoning the body to a sacrificial death in the full faith that God is beyond the darkness of the grave. In either case, the very act is accompanied by a mysterious sense of the peace and joy of God, which is why the darkness of unknowing is described as full of light."

        "output": "Created light or truth is the polar opposite of creaturely darkness or falsehood, but God does not stand in relation to darkness and falsehood as its polar opposite, for this would degrade Him to equality with them. The goodness of God is therefore in no dualistic or mutually interdependent relationship with evil, as is purely human goodness. Our created minds cannot grasp the mystery of evil because they cannot rise above dualism and conceive an order of goodness, which is definitively not evil and yet is not the equal and opposite of evil. Because purely human goodness is the equal and opposite of evil, it can have no final victory over it. But God has final victory over evil because He is not in a dualistic relation to it. Evil is creaturely, and the dualistic relation can be between one creature and another, but not between Creator and creature."

Under these circumstances the thief is proved guilty by reasoning from evidence gathered at the scene of the crime, or from other sources. His guilt is not demonstrated beyond all possible doubt because his crime was not seen. There is a remote chance that someone else committed it. But the court is assured of his guilt because there is no flaw in the chain of reasoning that concludes his guilt from the evidence. In the same way the existence of God cannot be demonstrated beyond all possible doubt because he cannot be seen. He is invisible and intangible."

We are thus led to the thought of God as one who is absolute consciousness, absolute wholeness and unity, and absolute freedom from other than self-imposed limitation. Therefore to say that God is personal is in no sense to limit or belittle him."

Two things, however, may safely be claimed. First, it is clear that belief in God is more reasonable than any other theory of ultimate Reality that human reason has to offer. Secondly, it is also clear that a reasoned consideration of God\u2019s existence and nature shows that this central doctrine of Christianity, together with its necessary implications, is not at all the crude, na\u00efve, and superstitious notion it is currently supposed to be."

All we have to do is to turn around\u2014repent. We can no more escape from union with God than we can escape from the present moment, and not only have we done nothing to deserve such a privilege, but almost everything to oppose it."

Its essence is that Holy Matrimony is constituted by two baptized persons entering into the marriage contract and living together as man and wife. Because they are baptized they are one with Christ and partakers of the divine nature and the divine love. Thus the love that they have for one another must be a degree of agape, God\u2019s own love, for which reason their union is analogous to the union of God and the world in Christ. Such is the basic principle upon which the whole structure of the doctrine depends."

Only God, being infinite, can give himself wholly to many objects. It is permanent, \u201ctil death do us part,\u201d because to give oneself wholly in love means that you give not only what you are now, but also what you will be; you give your whole life, both as it expands in space and in time."

Eros is self-love; it is the love of the sensation, the emotion within oneself that another person arouses. In essence, natural love is to be in love with the state of being in love. The other person is merely the occasion for this state. \u201cEros,\u201d writes Denis de Rougemont, \u201ctreated a fellow-creature as but an illusory excuse and occasion for taking fire.\u201d"

The keynote of Christian marriage is therefore wholeness, which is after all the same word as holiness. It is the product of a love in which the lover gives himself wholly to all of the beloved, not a mind, not a soul, not just a woman in the abstract, but that totality of aspects and qualities that adds up to a unique human being."

In common with eating, sleeping, moving, and thinking, it is a faculty that becomes evil only when misused. The Church does teach that sex becomes a source of evil when separated from agape-love, and love in that sense implies a marriage."

You get behind a stall to protect you from the people, just in the same way as the judge."

I want to consider it from two points of view. First of all, the original action of Jesus in being with his intimate disciples before he was crucified and instituting what was for those people in that time an absolutely outrageous ceremony. He took the bread and broke it and said, \u201cThis is my body.\u201d Then he took the cup and said, \u201cThis is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you and for many for the remission of sins. Drink it.\u201d"

We are killing something, whether it be vegetables, cows, chickens, turkeys, or whatnot. We are all killing something in order to live. Each one of us, deep down in his heart, has probably a profound sense of guilt for living only at the expense of other life. So when Jesus said \u201cThis is my blood which is shed for you for the remission (the putting away) of sins,\u201d it means this: Don\u2019t feel guilty anymore that you have to drink the grapes and eat the crushed wheat, because all that you eat is me, and I\u2019m offering myself to you and it is my pleasure."

So the worship of God is not what man does to God, but what God does to himself through man. Thus, for example, when Benedictine monks recite the psalms in what they call the Divine Office, they have the idea that the words of the song are the words of the Holy Spirit, not their own personal words. When they sing the songs, the Holy Spirit is talking through their mouths. All worship thus originates in God and returns to God."

It is not the confrontation of I, man, with Thou, God, because where do these things that confront each other come from?"

For it is the understanding of modern physics that what is going on in the world, what we are, is simply pattern."

The material of the knot keeps changing but the pattern of the knot remains the same. In just this way, each one of us is recognizable as an individual by virtue of being a consistent pattern of behavior."

It is also called libido, and that means \u201cblind lust.\u201d Likewise Ernst Haeckel thought of the energy of the world as blind energy. It was all mechanical, and our second great model of the world, which I shall call the fully automatic model, was a carryover from the Judeo-Christian model; it was an artifact, and thus a machine, but the artificer and the controller, the personal God, had disappeared, and you were simply left with the mechanism."

Most citizens of the United States who claim to be religious are either Christians or Jews, inheriting a form of religion that is based on a monarchical model of the universe. But the nation itself is a republic, ideally and theoretically democratic, having philosophical origins in an outburst of mysticism that occurred in Western Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, associated with such individuals as Meister Eckhart, John of Ruysbroek, Angelus Silesius, and Richard Tauler, and with such movements as the Anabaptists, the Brothers of the Free Spirit, the Levellers, and the Quakers, which arose in the three centuries following as a consequence of this mystical outburst."

It realizes and implements the views that all men are equal in the sight of God, or rather, at the level of their inmost divinity.

        "output": "How can one believe that a republic is the best form of government if, at the same time, one believes that the universe is a monarchy? For, obviously, if the universe is a monarchy with God himself in charge, then monarchical principles are the best for ruling. Jews, Catholics, and Fundamentalist Protestants believe emphatically that God is the heavenly king and father who must above all be obeyed. However, is it possible to be religious, to have faith in God, without believing that the universe is a monarchy? Does the idea of God necessarily imply the principle of monarchy at the base of the universe?"

        "output": "Surely not, for there are, outside the Western world, many traditional and, for want of a better word, religious views of the universe wherein God\u2014or whatever name may be used for the ultimate reality\u2014is not conceived as a monarch. This would generally be true for the Hindu, and most definitely for the Buddhist and Taoist. The Hindu does not see God as ruling the universe as a king imposes order by force on inferior subjects. He sees God, not as ruling, but as acting the world as a drama in which he is the player of all the parts, so that the whole multiplicity of individual beings are not his subjects but his roles and masks (personae)."

At the present time this is giving us considerable trouble, especially in the industrial-electronic, democratic-republican style of culture that has been emerging in the modern world. For we are being brought up under the sway of two mutually inconsistent philosophies. On the one hand, we are told that we must be responsible, and that it\u2019s up to us, as independent citizens in equality with all others, to assume responsibility for the government of our country. On the other hand, instead of doing just that, we are also looking over our shoulders for support and authority from tradition, law, and monarchical order deriving from the father and the past."

It would be quite inconsistent if we were to exempt the scientist from the account which science gives of human behavior in general. (Skinner, 1953, p. 446)"

The reality status of the modes of consciousness induced by these chemicals becomes, then, a matter of most serious concern for the guardians of our mental health, for psychiatrists and psychologists, philosophers and ministers, for every scientific investigator of the nature of consciousness, and, above all, for a large section of the general public curious and eager to get \u201cthe experience\u201d for reasons of all kinds."

        "output": "What we know, positively and scientifically, about psychedelic chemicals is that they bring about certain alterations of sense perception, of emotional level and tone, of identity feeling, of the interpretation of sense data, and of the sensations of time and space. The nature of these alterations depends on three variables: the chemical itself (type and dosage), the psycho-physiological state of the subject, and the social and aesthetic context of the experiment. Their physiological side effects are minimal, though there are conditions (e.g., disease of the liver) in which some of them may be harmful."

Of these two, the latter, which I had to use abroad in countries where it is not outlawed, proved to be the better. It does not induce bizarre alterations of sensory perception, and medical studies indicate that it may not, save in great excess, have the dangerous side effects of LSD, such as psychotic episodes."

No one needs a drug to see that.\u201d Quite so, but every insight has degrees of intensity.

By polar awareness one sees that things that are explicitly different are implicitly one: self and other, subject and object, left and right, male and female\u2014and then, a little more surprisingly, solid and space, figure and background, pulse and interval, saints and sinners, and police and criminals, ingroups and outgroups.

The Western scientist may rationally perceive the idea of organism-environment, but he does not ordinarily feel this to be true.

In the West we are chiefly preoccupied with the transformation of mental states that are peculiar to relatively few individuals, and that arise out of certain special conditioning circumstances of the individual\u2019s history. But Asian psychology interests itself in the transformation of states that are common to mankind as a whole, and is thus, as it were, a psychotherapy of the \u201cnormal\u201d man. It proposes to change patterns of thought and feeling that are characteristic of the society as well as of the individual, though this does not amount in practice to an attempt to change the society as a whole.

        "output": "For it is recognized that in any given society relatively few individuals seem to have the capacity and the interest to liberate themselves from patterns of conditioning common to all. It follows that for an Oriental psychology, \u201cnormalcy\u201d could never be a standard of mental health\u2014where \u201cnormalcy\u201d means the ways of thinking and feeling, the conventions and life-goals, acceptable to the majority of persons in a particular culture. Likewise, the diseases of the mind are not recognized in terms of deviation from the normal. From this (Oriental) standpoint, there is a clear absurdity in trying to achieve the \u201chappy adjustment\u201d of an individual to the conventions of a society that is largely composed of unhappy people.

Buddhist and Hindu psychology agree in ascribing this general unhappiness to avidya\u2014the Sanskrit term for a special type of ignorance or unconscious- ness, which is the failure to perceive that certain desires and activities are self- contradictory and \u201cviciously circular.\u201d The victims of avidya are thus described as being in the state of samsara\u2014the \u201cround\u201d or \u201cwhirl\u201d\u2014a life pattern that, having set itself a self-contradictory goal, revolves or oscillates interminably to the increasing discomfiture of those involved.

It is pointed out that pleasure and pain are relative experiences, such that a life consisting wholly or even principally of pleasure is as far beyond any possibility of experience as a world in which \u201ceverything is up\u201d and nothing down. To the degree that one avoids pain one also eliminates pleasure, and so achieves a way of life that is merely indifferent and boring. "

        "output": "Consequently a life devoted to the pursuit of pleasure or happiness is devoted to a self-contradictory goal, because, in so far as one succeeds in gaining pleasure, there is necessarily a proportionate increase in some form of pain\u2014often the simple, but most unpleasant, anxiety of losing what one has gained. Buddhist psychology, in particular, emphasizes as perhaps the major form of self-contradiction a division of experience into subject and object, thinker and thought, feeler and feeling. According to Buddhist psychology, the notion that \u201cI\u201d am in some way different from the feelings that I now feel or the thought that I now think, the notion that man\u2019s psycho-organism contains an ego as the enduring subject of a changing panorama of sensations, is an illusion based on memory (smrti)."

For Oriental thought, the past exists only conventionally. It has no real existence, being a logical inference from present memory\u2014an abstraction, and not a real, concrete experience. Therapy consists in releasing the mind from treating the abstract as the concrete, without, however, losing the power of abstraction."

Mushin is a kind of \u201cinspired spontaneity.\u201d It is the art of making the appropriate responses to life without the interruption of that wobbling and indecisive state that we call \u201cchoosing.\u201d In other words, mushin is when acts and decisions are \u201chanded over\u201d to the same unconscious processes, which organize the ingenious structure of the body."

This is not to be confused with Western views of subjective idealism.

        "output": "The chief difficulty is that the standard systems of psychotherapy\u2014Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian, as well as the more physiologically oriented systems of \u201corthodox\u201d psychiatry\u2014are still all too unconscious of their own identification with some of the more basic social conventions. For many years it has been fashionable to underrate the power of ideas as factors in producing neurosis, and the emphasis has been laid on the traumatic experiences of childhood, a fashion reflecting the theoretical assumption that physiology is more \u201creal\u201d than ideology."

Thus many readers of the above may have formed the impression that the real, concrete, and nonconceptual world (corresponding in our analogy to the Rorschach blot) is in fact a disorder, a lawless and directionless wasteland. But this, again, is but another symptom of unconscious acceptance of a conventional pattern of thought that provides \u201ccon\u201d as the only alternative to \u201cpro.\u201d"

This was all very well so long as the controlling mind, soul, will, or ego could be trusted. But one of the main insights of Christianity, of Jesus, St. Paul, and St. Augustine, was that the root of evil lay in the spiritual sphere, in the perversion of the controlling will. This insight actually destroyed the usefulness of the soul-body dualism, though it was not effectively questioned until the materialistic and naturalistic viewpoints of nineteenth-century science suggested a theory of man in which mind and will could be considered as operations of the body."

It seemed impossible to take it seriously since for all practical purposes human beings had to feel themselves to be conscious wills directing and mastering nature both inside and outside their own organisms. Through the technology that arose from nineteenth-century science, men succeeded in controlling nature as never before, and this very success confirmed the feeling that, more and more, the rational will has to stand in opposition to natural spontaneity."

According to our system of typical symbols, the spotlight, being a pinpoint sort of thing, will be male, and the floodlight, being diffused, will be female.

That is the secret power of the feminine."

The God-King who is in charge of everything and rules it by spiritual violence. And that\u2019s a totally obsolete model in a universe which is organic or at least quantum mechanics as distinguished from Newton\u2019s mechanics. That\u2019s why we are feeling our powerlessness.

Both are based on the same false premise that you are separate from your environment. You\u2019re only a puppet so long as you define yourself that way. But when you realize that what you are truly is that you are your whole physical organism, and that includes your brain and nervous system and all the rest \u2014 the human brain is far more intelligent than any human ego because it is an organized system which we cannot yet describe in language."

And that doesn\u2019t mean think. It means use your nervous system, which is to say we have to relearn being spontaneous. A person only thinks when he doesn\u2019t trust himself."

It isn\u2019t necessarily. We see it only as two alternatives. We have to learn a new dimension: What do you really feel like? And to do that you have to stop categorizing, stop thinking.

So if the professor of pathology says somebody has cancer there\u2019s no question about it. He has cancer. If, in 1600, the professor of theology said someone had heresy, it too was a serious problem.

When we get this behavior, we say that fellow is all mixed up because he doesn\u2019t go along with our feeling of what isn\u2019t mixed up, what is straight conduct.

We have to get back to a direct relationship with the physical world. Even when one says \u201cphysical world,\u201d that is a concept. Physical is an Aristotelian idea about the nature of things.

The philosophy of nature of the nineteenth century has become the common sense of the twentieth century, and is widely accepted in the medical profession, in the psychotherapeutic professions, and in sociology. From the point of view of a physicist or an advanced mathematician or biologist, however, there is a serious question as to whether psychiatry is a genuine science, and even whether medicine is a genuine science. These professions have not caught up with quantum theory and are still holding Newtonian views of the universe, thinking about their subjects in terms of mechanical models."

Or I say, \u201cI must live because I have children and I\u2019m responsible.\u201d But then all I do is teach my children to have the same feeling, and they will teach their children to have the same feeling, and life will continue to be a drag for everybody concerned."

Some of us say, \u201cIt\u2019s not death I\u2019m afraid of, it\u2019s dying.\u201d Well, that makes sense, but then medicine doesn\u2019t help: medicine prolongs dying. It doesn\u2019t really prolong life, I mean, it does sometimes, but for old people particularly, it prolongs dying. Terminal cancer is prolonged dying. Still, there is something real spooky about death."

That\u2019s quite something to think about. I find thinking about death is one of the most creative things one can do. To go to sleep and never wake up. Fancy that. It won't be like going into the dark forever. It won't be like being buried alive forever. There'll be no problems at all; there\u2019s nothing to regret. It will be as if you had never existed at all, and not only you, but everything else as well. It never was there. No further problems. But wait a minute. I seem to remember something like that. That was just the way it was before I was born. And yet, here I am. I exist, and once, I didn\u2019t."

They gambol all over the place, and, for example, they\u2019ll follow a human ship and swim circles around it; then they'll set their tail at a twenty-six degree angle and let the bow-wake carry them. No effort, see... just keep your tail that way and the ship will take you along."
