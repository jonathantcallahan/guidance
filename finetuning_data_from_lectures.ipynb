You can afford an artist, you can afford to buy paintings if you have surplus money; that's a luxury. So you can support an artist and we call it Fine Arts, the completely useless person who makes paintings which are sort of big labels or posters that you stick on your utilitarian walls to decorate them. But on the other hand, the artist is the man who shows you the future long before everybody else sees it. The artist is the eye-opener just because the artist is distinct in role from the preacher and the philosopher. So, the role of the artist is very fascinating because he appears to be the clown, the jester, the absolutely unimportant and irrelevant person, and yet it's actually through the artist that we learn how to live, not through the preacher, not through the philosopher, not through the professor. It is the artist who teaches us, whether he does it visually with painting or on sculpture, actually above all in music.\"\n",

In Hinduism, the fundamental source of life is called 'lak'. 'Lak' in Sanskrit means the word to speak, but not so much the word that communicates, as the as theodorant, the flow of tone. So, you have in India the use of mantra, the use of chanted words as one of the very basic forms of yoga understanding the mystery of the world. The Hindus use the word 'Om', which would be spelled out A-U-M because the letter 'A' starts in the back of the throat, you push it forward through the vowel to 'Ow', 'M' at the lips. So the word 'Om' comprehends the whole range of sound. It's called the 'pranava', all sounds are basically the sound of 'Om'. There, the word not only signifies but also is what there is; everything is Om. Om, then, the whole universe is of his Om, and it has no meaning except it is the very pulse of life.\"\n",

I happen to have acquired from Timothy Leary some of this extraordinary Mexican mushroom, and I was feeling awful. I had come back from a trip to the east, was tired, and I had a sore throat and just felt lousy. So I took this thing and I found myself listening to this Hindu music. I didn't know what it was, and I thought when I listened to this, 'What kind of idiocy is going on?' I thought this in my friend with whom I was spending the day, a pretty wild kind of fellow, and I thought he'd put on a tape recording of his and his friend's antics; it was like children making faces, although this is just something absolutely absurd. So I said, 'Roger, hey let me see the album...No, not the case here, it says classical music of India, edited by Anna and Daniel', who is the most scholarly respectable pundit on the subject of Hindu music. I said, 'Somebody's pulling my leg, yeah? Not at all. Here was this just a babbling sound.'\"\n",

Well, I listened to this and I suddenly realized that that's what life's all about, and you know, it was the most fantastic, sudden recognition that everything in this world is gloriously meaningless; that's what's happening. We're all taught by our mothers and fathers, put a value on it when it goes a certain way. The rhythm of life goes in a certain way, when we say 'Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out' because that may be the end. What will the end be? Spunk. Okay, what's wrong with that? Things that stop, have to stop; things that go on, have to go off; and things that go off, have to go on. But you see, we get involved by putting a value on it. Alright, now I could say that's bad, you shouldn't do it, but at the same time, getting involved and putting values on it's all part of the game too, getting hung up, getting hooked. So you don't get unhooked by saying to yourself, 'I shouldn't be attached, I shouldn't do this, I shouldn't do that.' All you do is you see that getting hooked on it is simply another form of it, no nonsense, more jazz.\"\n",

In this way, the artist has a peculiar role in society, very very interesting because the artist is a very deceptive fellow. He appears to be the supreme luxury, the irrelevant fellow. You can afford an artist, you can afford to buy paintings if you have surplus money; that's a luxury. So you can support an artist and we call it Fine Arts, the completely useless person who makes paintings which are sort of big labels or posters that you stick on your utilitarian walls to decorate them. But on the other hand, the artist is the man who shows you the future long before everybody else sees it. The artist is the eye-opener just because the artist is distinct in role from the preacher and the philosopher. So, the role of the artist is very fascinating because he appears to be the clown, the jester, the absolutely unimportant and irrelevant person, and yet it's actually through the artist that we learn how to live, not through the preacher, not through the philosopher, not through the professor. It is the artist who teaches us, whether he does it visually with painting or on sculpture, actually above all in music.\"\n",

In Hinduism, the fundamental source of life is called 'lak'. 'Lak' in Sanskrit means the word to speak, but not so much the word that communicates, as the as theodorant, the flow of tone. So, you have in India the use of mantra, the use of chanted words as one of the very basic forms of yoga understanding the mystery of the world. The Hindus use the word 'Om', which would be spelled out A-U-M because the letter 'A' starts in the back of the throat, you push it forward through the vowel to 'Ow', 'M' at the lips. So the word 'Om' comprehends the whole range of sound. It's called the 'pranava', all sounds are basically the sound of 'Om'. There, the word not only signifies but also is what there is; everything is Om. Om, then, the whole universe is of his Om, and it has no meaning except it is the very pulse of life.\"\n",

I happen to have acquired from Timothy Leary some of this extraordinary Mexican mushroom, and I was feeling awful. I had come back from a trip to the east, was tired, and I had a sore throat and just felt lousy. So I took this thing and I found myself listening to this Hindu music. I didn't know what it was, and I thought when I listened to this, 'What kind of idiocy is going on?' I thought this in my friend with whom I was spending the day, a pretty wild kind of fellow, and I thought he'd put on a tape recording of his and his friend's antics; it was like children making faces, although this is just something absolutely absurd. So I said, 'Roger, hey let me see the album...No, not the case here, it says classical music of India, edited by Anna and Daniel', who is the most scholarly respectable pundit on the subject of Hindu music. I said, 'Somebody's pulling my leg, yeah? Not at all. Here was this just a babbling sound.'\"\n",

Well, I listened to this and I suddenly realized that that's what life's all about, and you know, it was the most fantastic, sudden recognition that everything in this world is gloriously meaningless; that's what's happening. We're all taught by our mothers and fathers, put a value on it when it goes a certain way. The rhythm of life goes in a certain way, when we say 'Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out' because that may be the end. What will the end be? Spunk. Okay, what's wrong with that? Things that stop, have to stop; things that go on, have to go off; and things that go off, have to go on. But you see, we get involved by putting a value on it. Alright, now I could say that's bad, you shouldn't do it, but at the same time, getting involved and putting values on it's all part of the game too, getting hung up, getting hooked. So you don't get unhooked by saying to yourself, 'I shouldn't be attached, I shouldn't do this, I shouldn't do that.' All you do is you see that getting hooked on it is simply another form of it, no nonsense, more jazz.\"\n",
