Editors’ Preface 


he year 2015 marked the centenary of Alan Watts’ birth. He lived 

only 58 years, and once conjectured that his relevance would fade 
within five decades beyond his death. Yet, nearly 45 years after his 1973 passing, 
interest in Watts’ life and work is not subsiding. His books remain in vogue, 
and popular audiences in large numbers now view his audiovisual materials 
via YouTube. Moreover, contemporary scholars are currently mapping Watts’ 
historical influence, and surveying his ongoing impact in a variety of academic 
disciplines. It is in service to this scholarly effort that we have gathered and 
organized, thematically and chronologically, the present anthology of writings 
and lectures by Watts. All materials herein, particularly endnotes, references, 
and figures were formatted for consistency with the American Psychological 
Association’s publication style. Occasionally, though rarely, editorial comments 
were added as endnotes for clarification of subject matter. 

As this manuscript reaches publication, a substantial debt of thanks is 
coming due. First, to everyone who generously offered permission to reprint 
materials. A University of West Georgia faculty grant to Don Rice helped cover 
any reprint fees. Jean-Claude van Itallie and the Shantigar Foundation supported 
Peter Columbus’ writing and editing. Lisa Prolman’s interlibrary loan staff at 
the Public Library of Greenfield, Massachusetts, helped locate, identify, and 
acquire materials necessary for the text. Fred Richards kindly allowed use of 
his artwork for the cover. Three anonymous reviewers (particularly “reviewer 
#3”) offered critical commentaries affording important revisions to an early 
draft of the introduction. Another anonymous reviewer subsequently offered 
practical suggestions for final revision. The State University of New York Press 
editorial, technical, and marketing staff, including the late Nancy Ellegate,

Introduction 


Alan Watts and the Academic Enterprise 


Peter J. Columbus and Donadrian L. Rice 


As in some economies the rich keep getting richer and the poor poorer, 
so in the overspecialized disciplines of modern scholarship the learned get 
more learned and the ignorant get more ignorant—until the two classes 
can hardly talk to each other. I have dedicated my work to an attempt to 
bridge that gap. 


—Alan Watts, 1975b, p. xx 


his collection of academic essays by Alan Watts serves to com- 

memorate the centenary of his birth on the Feast of the Epiphany— 

January 6—in 1915. Watts was born into a middle-class family at Rowan Tree 
Cottage, in the village of Chislehurst, located on the outskirts of London. He 
was raised in the Church of England, educated at elite Anglican preparatory 
academies—including King’s School in Canterbury (1928-1932)—and studied 
at Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois (1941-1944). 
Receiving the Sacrament of Holy Orders on the Feast of the Ascension, May 18, 
1944, Watts served as Episcopal priest, chaplain and theologian at Northwestern 
University (1944-1950), professor of comparative philosophy at the American 
Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco (1951-1957), and freelance philosopher 
(1958-1973), including visiting scholar at Harvard University (1962-1964). He held 
a Master of Sacred Theology degree from Seabury-Western Seminary (1948), 
an Honorary Doctorate of Divinity from the University of Vermont (1958), 
and was a Fellow of the Society for Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture. 
Watts integrated his Anglo-Catholic religious formation with knowledge 

of Buddhism, Daoism, and Hinduism toward resolving problems of ontological 
estrangement in the twentieth-century West (Morgan, 2008). His 1947 book, 
Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion, was hailed by Fr. Alan 


2 INTRODUCTION 


Griffith Whittemore (1890-1960), superior of the Order of the Holy Cross and 
abbot of Holy Cross Monastery in West Park, New York, as “one of the most 
penetrating works that ever has come from the pen of an Anglican author” (as 
cited in Sadler, 1985, p. 2). In the 1950s, Watts’ vital counterpoints to capricious 
interpretations of Buddhist doctrine rendered him “the most influential figure 
to come out of the era of Beat Zen” (Coleman, 2001, p. 63). He subsequently 
offered innovative understandings of spiritual and religious consciousness amid 
the countercultural upheavals of the psychedelic 1960s (Roszak, 1969/1995), 
and was a formative influence within the “human potential movement”—the 
diverse association of psychotherapists and alternative education centers explor- 
ing groundbreaking approaches to psychological growth, personal insight, and 
creative expression in the 1960s and 1970s (Kripal, 2007). The death of Alan 
Watts, likely due to a combination of heart disease and work fatigue, occurred 
during his sleep on November 16 in 1973. It was the eve of the Feast of Saint 
Hugh, the patron saint of Watts’ first Anglican boarding school. 

Note that two book-length biographies on Watts are available. Both are 
informative, if sometimes unreliable. The first, by Stuart (1976/1983), empha- 
sizes Watts’ professional life but projects a rather cynical subtext (see Sadler’s 
1976 review). The second, by Furlong (1986/2001), places greater emphasis on 
Watts’ personal life by capitalizing partly on salacious (but dubious) accounts 
of Watts’ first marriage and his reputation for alcoholic excess. Perhaps the 
fairest biographical considerations of Watts are brief essays by Gidlow (1972), 
Sadler (1974a, 1974b) and, most recently, Chadwick (2015). See also Watts’ 
(1973a) autobiography and, for a narrative account of Watts’ curriculum vitae, 
see Columbus and Rice (2012b, pp. 2-3). 


POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE 


A compilation of scholarly writings and lectures by Alan Watts may seem coun- 
terintuitive and counterfactual given his prominent and ubiquitous reputation 
as a nonacademic writer. Jackson’s (1984) review of Watts’ life and work, for 
example, concluded that his “most important public role is that of popularizer 
of Oriental religions to the West; it seems safe to say that no modern writer 
has exceeded his contributions here” (p. 99, italics added). Likewise, in the 
twenty-first century, Watts is remembered as “the principle popularizer of Zen 
Buddhism to American audiences in the 1950 and 1960s” (Kabil, 2012, p. 47) and 
“the great popularizer of Asian religions” (Seigler, 2010). Although “popular- 
izing” —rendering information as accessible, comprehensible, and appreciable—is 
an activity professors engage regularly in college classrooms, the moniker may 
be the antonym of academic heft when applied to Watts. Jackson (1984) wrote: 


Though no scholar, he had a wide acquaintance with Asian religious 
thought and, what is more important, a genius for explaining and 


INTRODUCTION 3 


dramatizing the Eastern concepts. . . . No recent Western writer has 
more successfully presented Oriental religious conceptions to a wide 
audience or awakened so many readers to the relevance of such con- 
ceptions to twentieth-century life. (p. 99, italics added) 


The popularizer soubriquet attached to Watts is further complicated with 
the addition of a “guru” appellation. Watts has been called “America’s guru” 
(Review, 1973, p. 117), “the guru of the Beat Generation” (Stuart, 1976/1983, 
p. 180), “guru to disenchanted youth” (Curti, 1980, p. 371), and “a guru to the 
counterculture of the fifties and sixties” (Ballantyne, 1989, p. 437). The two 
labels affixed to Watts may be conjoined in contemporary thinking, for example, 
“pop guru” (Oldmeadow, 2004, p. 259), “pop Zen guru” (Crocker, 2013, p. 1) 
and, stated more elaborately, “New Age guru famous for his popularizations 
of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy” (Zaretsky, 2015, p. 209). The combination 
of “popularizer” and “guru” tags on Alan Watts can imply or suggest a radical 
compromising of academic rigor. The Dictionary of American Religious Biography 
states: “There was a core of serious intention within his efforts to enhance 
greater understanding of Oriental religions, but Watts succumbed to popularizing 
and became a guru to various forms of counter-culture in the 1950s and 1960s” 
(Bowden, 1993, pp. 584-585, italics added). Versluis (2014) channels this stream 
of thought into the contemporary conversation by placing Watts within the 
category of “renegade religious figures” (p. 6) who ran afoul of traditional 
academic sensibilities. Watts instead became a “proto-guru,” that is to say, “one 
of the first celebrity spiritual advisors” (p. 87). 

Given the “popular guru” motif running through discussions about Alan 
Watts during his lifetime and after his death, some scholars view his work as 
virtually antithetical to the academic enterprise. As Ponce (1987) suggested, Watts 
is “the religious philosopher whom everybody reads at night, but nobody seems 
to want to acknowledge during the day” (p. 241n6). In the daylight hours of 
academe his accessible and prolific discussions of abstruse subject matters are 
seen by certain lettered factions as lacking scholarly diligence and fine distinc- 
tion. Adams (1958), for example, criticized Watts for abridging Buddhist tenets 
so as “to trifle with the simplicities of the half-educated” (p. 630). According 
to Braun (1961), “the more literate of the Zen aficionados admit that Watts is 
the Norman Vincent Peale of Zen” (p. 180). Prebish (1978) as well referred to 
Watts’ “somewhat amateurish attempt to explain Zen in the context of modern 
science and psychology” (p. 161). Others in the academy consider Watts’ literary 
accessibility as symptomatic of a superficial and pedestrian temperament: He 
was “not a deep or profound thinker” (Jackson, 1984, p. 99), “not a particularly 
original thinker” (Fuller, 2004, p. 190), and “his mystical experiences were quite 
mediocre and shallow” (Nordstrom & Pilgrim, 1980, p. 387). 

In the years after his death, and due much to his popularity among wide- 
ranging audiences, Watts was mostly marginalized by those in higher education. 


4 INTRODUCTION 


Nordstrom and Pilgrim (1980), for example, acknowledged as much in their 
scathing review of Watts’ mystical philosophy: 


Our critique of Watts’ mysticism may well strike even the unsympathetic 
reader of his work as excessively harsh and perhaps even unbalanced. 
We are well aware of the fact that we have been severe with Watts in 
this review. At the same time, however, we are aware of the enormous 
contribution he has made in awakening people all over the world to 
the spiritual path, particularly in the area of Eastern philosophy and 
religion. We know as well that for many Watts is a holy man, who 
has been all but canonized in certain spiritual circles. It is precisely 
because of Watts’ influence that we have been harsh. (p. 397) 


Moreover, paradigmatic shifts and programmatic changes in various aca- 
demic disciplines, including postcolonial studies and Buddhist studies, eventually 
rendered Watts’ thinking as seriously suspect or largely irrelevant in the minds 
of many thinkers. Summarizing the ensuing reticence about Watts, D. L. Smith 
(2010) writes: “The current climate of academic opinion makes most readers 
reluctant to admit that they ever took him seriously” (p. 16). Additionally, Smith 
points out, “scholars still occasionally define themselves over and against him, 
using him as a cautionary example of just how wrong modern appropriations 
of Buddhism can be” (p. 35n5). 

The discomfiture with Watts’ academic marginalization remains palpable 
to some scholars in the present day. Philosophy professor Samir Chopra, for 
example, writes the following in his online blog dated September 24, 2014: 


I have a confession to make: I enjoy reading Alan Watts’ books. This 
simple statement of one of my reading pleasures, this revelation of 
one of my tastes in books and intellectual pursuits, shouldn’t need to 
be a confession, a term that conjures up visions of sin and repentance 
and shame. But it is, a veritable coming out of the philosophical closet. 


Chopra continues: 


I am supposed to be “doing serious philosophy,” reading and writing 
rigorous philosophy; the works of someone most commonly described 
as a “popularizer” do not appear to make the cut. Even worse, not 
only was Watts thus a panderer to the masses, but he wrote about 
supposedly dreamy, insubstantial, woolly headed, mystical philoso- 
phies. An analytical philosopher would be an idiot to read him. Keep 
it under wraps, son. 


Adding to obfuscation of Watts’ academic credibility is the personal recount- 
ing of his own educational story. Throughout his life Watts had rather tumultuous 


INTRODUCTION 5 


relationships with formal institutions of learning. Readers familiar with Watts’ 
(1973a) autobiography will know of (1) his traumatic 1922 exiling at the age of 
seven years from the blissful Rowan Tree Cottage to his first religious boarding 
school: “I felt myself given over to the care of maniacal bullies” (p. 105); (2) the 
botched scholarship exam in 1932 that blocked his chance of attending Trinity 
College at Oxford: “I failed to get a scholarship to Trinity because, as I was 
later told, I wrote the essay examination on Courage in the style of Nietzsche, 
having just read his Zarathustra. Some theologically occidental examiner must 
have been offended” (p. 118); (3) the advice of Marguerite Block, editor of the 
Review of Religion, who in 1940 counseled against Watts pursuing doctoral stud- 
ies: “She said . . . it isn’t worth it. I simply wouldn’t waste your time with all 
that picayune, myopic-minded, long-drawn-out, mole-eyed academic ritual” (p. 
175); (4) his abrupt resignations from Northwestern University and the Episcopal 
Church in 1950: “I chose the priesthood because it was the only formal role of 
Western society into which, at the time, I could even begin to fit... . But it 
was an ill-fitting suit of clothes” (p. 214); and (5) his 1957 resignation from the 
American Academy of Asian Studies where, as he later wrote, “I was as much 
out of place in the groves of academe as in the Church, . . . I was never, never 
going to be an organization man” (pp. 319-320). 

Calling himself “an intellectual critic of the intellectual life” (p. 5), Watts 
(1973a) remained, in his maturity, intensely disparaging of the academic enter- 
prise by viewing it as rather uninspiring, humorless, and too concerned with 
conventional rules and details. He observed: “You cannot maintain proper status 
in an American university without cultivated mediocrity. You must be academi- 
cally ‘sound,’ which is to be preposterously and phenomenally dull” (p. 132). 
Further along in his autobiography, Watts referred to “the dubious objective 
of impressing the more dreary pandits of the American Oriental Society, the 
in-group of academic Orientalists who, as librarians, philological nitpickers, and 
scholarly drudges, dissolve all creative interest into acidulated pedantry” (p. 165). 
Though Jackson (1984) conjectured that Watts’ “sensitivities were undoubtedly 
inflamed by . . . J. K. Shyrock’s [1937] dismissal of The Spirit of Zen in the Journal 
of the American Oriental Society” (p. 100n22; note also that Watts himself was 
a member of the Society), it may nevertheless seem unsurprising that Watts 
(1973a) dubbed himself a “philosophical entertainer” because, he wrote, “I have 
some difficulty in taking myself and my work seriously—or perhaps the right 
word is ‘pompously’” (p. 252). 


AIMS AND SCOPE: VALIDITY, RELIABILITY, NECESSITY 


The preceding discussion calls into question the propriety of the present manu- 
script in three key ways. First is the question of validity: Does Alan Watts have a 
body of work that could reasonably and justifiably be called academic or schol- 
arly? Watts’ legacy includes a corpus that, while occasionally ignored or denied, 
contains learned writings published in scholastic journals and monographs, and 


6 INTRODUCTION 


sophisticated presentations at professional conferences and symposia. Perhaps 
indicative of scholarly neglect of Watts, only three extant English-language 
books approach his work with academic rigor, including Keightley (1986), Bran- 
nigan (1988), and Columbus and Rice (2012a). A fourth text, by Clark (1978), 
is a conservative defense of Christian theism vis-a-vis Watts’ mystical philoso- 
phy. However, see Columbus (2015a) for a bibliographic resource of primarily 
academic articles and chapters on Watts’ life and work plus a listing of Watts’ 
major books, including posthumously published volumes. 

Though sometimes forgotten, Watts’ books were regularly and substantively 
reviewed in leading academic journals (see Appendix). Much of his work was 
recognized as ahead of its time and located at the forefront of emerging trends 
in Western intellectual and religious life (Columbus & Rice, 2012a). Heide 
(2013) notes likewise: 


The perspicacity of Watts’ thinking is jaw-dropping. He was the 
first person in the West to write seriously about Zen . . . the first to 
conduct a seminar at Esalen, and one of the first to propose linking 
Eastern philosophy with Western psychology. ... [He anticipated] 
the now-prominent distinction between spiritual quest and religious 
affiliation. Ingesting psychedelics two years before Timothy Leary did, 
Watts became a principle spokesman for their spiritual value and even 
proposed that their use be protected constitutionally. 

Watts wrote about the psychology of acceptance, one of the central 
issues in 21st-century cognitive behavioral psychotherapy as early as 
1939. His Nature, Man and Woman (1958) was one of the earliest feminist 
critiques of Western religion, preceding most others by decades, as 
well as a forerunner to the modern environmental movement. 


A conclusion to be drawn, in Heide’s (2013) view, is that Watts was a more 
important and substantive thinker than is typically remembered, acknowledged, 
or appreciated by considerable numbers of academics. Psychologist Diane Gehart 
(2012) concurs with Heide. She considers Watts “an important but seldom 
recognized early contributor to the field of family therapy.” Gehart writes: 


In his landmark book, Psychotherapy East and West, Watts (1961) was 
the first to make a connection between the premises of systemic fam- 
ily therapy and Buddhism, both recognizing that the perceiver and 
the perceived cannot be considered separately: the perceiver is inher- 
ently connected to and influences the perceived and vice versa. Watts 
encouraged the practice of family therapy, in which the individual is 
addressed—not alone—but in the context of relationships, society, and 
as Watts encouraged, the cosmos. Furthermore, Watts saw in family 
therapy techniques parallel to Buddhist traditions of koans that aim 
to identify and dissolve life’s double binds through paradox. (p. 22) 


INTRODUCTION 7 


Richards (2003) makes a similar observation regarding psychedelic research: 


When the man in the street, and even many mental health and 
religiously-trained professionals, hears the terms “entheogen” or “psy- 
chedelic drug,” the image that comes to mind seems to be a rebellious 
teenager in a tie-dyed T-shirt with rose-colored glasses about to do 
something crazy, or waiting in an emergency room for attention. Few 
know about, or recall, the profound value placed upon experiences 
catalyzed by these substances as reported by respected academicians 
in the past, such as... Alan Watts. (pp. 145-146) 


The selection of materials for the present volume was accordingly informed 
by four overlapping criteria, including Watts’ (1) contributions to professional 
journals, monographs, and edited books, (2) papers presented at academic confer- 
ences and symposia, (3) works produced during periods of grant funding from 
the Franklin J. Matchette Foundation (1950) and Bollingen Foundation (1951-1953, 
1962-1964), and (4) writings and lectures during his tenures at Seabury-Western 
Theological Seminary (1941-1944), Northwestern University (1944-1950), Ameri- 
can Academy of Asian Studies (1951-1957), and Harvard University (1962-1964). 
The contents range from Watts’ first academic journal article, published in 1941, 
to essays written in 1973, his final year of life. The works include materials 
appearing in the Review of Religion; Journal of Religious Thought; Philosophy East 
and West; American Journal of Psychoanalysis; Journal of Humanistic Psychology; New 
Politics; The Psychedelic Review; California Law Review; Existential Psychiatry; Journal 
of Transpersonal Psychology; The Eastern Buddhist; Asian Study Monographs; Advent 
Papers; and Chicago Review. Other offerings include conference and symposia pre- 
sentations at Stanford University; University of California-San Francisco Medical 
Center; Central Washington State College; Society for the Arts, Religion, and 
Contemporary Culture; and Mount Saviour Monastery. 

A second question, following from the first, implicates the issue of reli- 
ability: Does Watts’ thinking count as a dependable voice or relevant topic of 
conversation within contemporary academe? There is in the second decade of 
the twenty-first century an identifiable renaissance of interest in Alan Watts. His 
work is garnering renewed attention from emerging scholars and established 
thinkers in psychology, philosophy, religion, history, art and literary theory. This 
notice includes affirmative and critical considerations of Watts in relation to 
transcultural studies (Chen, 2013; Wang, 2009; Williams, 2014; Wolter, 2013);

2015); and postmodernism (Hungerford, 2010, p. 44; Shipley, 2012). 

The nascence of the twenty-first-century Wattsian renaissance can be seen 
in such late twentieth-century works as Bartholomeusz (1998), Beidler (1994), 
Dunbar (1994), Helminiak, (1998, pp. 281-284), and Norrman (1999). While it 
is beyond the scope of this discussion to consider the above studies individually 
and in detail, they serve en masse to exemplify a growing body of scholarship 
acknowledging the current relevance—problematical and/or commendable—of 
Watts and his work. In the Academy, therefore, supplements contemporary and 
continuing scholarship on Alan Watts with 30 erudite offerings by Watts himself. 

A third question begged from the preceding discussion concerns the issue 
of necessity: Is there a clear and present need for a comprehensive assemblage 
of Watts’ academic works? In the Academy is organized with a view to the 
general arc of thinking by Watts due to prevailing disagreements concern- 
ing the developmental trajectory of his intellectual life. There are differing 
opinions concerning the degree of continuity versus change in comparison 
with his earlier and later works. One point of view is that Watts’ later works 
were simply elaborative expressions of ideas, concepts, and categories acquired 
and developed early in his career (Ballantyne, 1989; Jackson, 1984; Snelling, 
1987). “Surveying Watts’ early writings,” observed Jackson, “one is amazed at 
the degree to which he had already arrived at the basic ideas that he would 
elaborate on for the next thirty-five years. In many ways his books were to be 
so many variations on a limited number of themes” (p. 94). Yet Ruland (1975) 
described Watts’ development as an “odyssey from Anglican theology, to meta- 
Catholic syncretism, and finally to his own version of an apophatic mysticism 
and Hindu pantheism” (p. 219). 

Conversely, Nordstrom and Pilgrim (1980) treated the same corpus as 
a collection of disparate and inchoate materials hence critically implying an 
incomprehensible absence of trajectory: “In the works of Alan Watts one finds 
a bewildering array of self-ascribed epithets ranging all the way from guru, sha- 
man, Christian theologian, and philosopher, to mystic, showman, sensualist, and 


INTRODUCTION 9 


egotist” (p. 381). Some thinkers bypass the issue. Brannigan (1988), for example, 
emphasized a recurring theme—the transition of ego to Self—throughout the 
entirety Watts’ work. Suligoj (1975) totalized and reduced the entirety of Watts’ 
works down to a set of three propositions and various corollary statements. 
A contrasting observation made from a twenty-first-century vantage point is 
that Watts’ mature offerings were qualitatively and creatively different from his 
earlier output in terms of his approach to various topics, selection of content, 
methods of analysis, and modes of discussion (Columbus, 2012). 

Assessments differ also concerning the apex of Watts’ thinking particularly 
with respect to when and how his philosophical vision was most vital and 
perceptive. Sadler (1974a, 1974b) points to the years from 1947 to 1958 when 
Watts was largely and readily associated with academic institutions. During 
this period, described by Sadler as Watts’ “vintage years,” he published six of 
his most influential books, including Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity 
of Mystical Religion (1947) at the age of 32, The Supreme Identity: An Essay on 
Oriental Metaphysic and the Christian Religion (1950) at 35 years of age, The Wis- 
dom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety (1951b) at age 36, Myth and 
Ritual in Christianity (1953c) at age 38, The Way of Zen (1957) at age 42, and 
Nature, Man and Woman (1958b/1970b) at age 43. Sadler (1974a) notes: “Out 
of the very tension between institutional conventions and his free spirit came 
his best work” (p. 121). 

Yet Jolicoeur (2000) expands the range of Watts’ “premiere periode” to 
include the years 1935 to 1958, and others point to Watts’ freelance period in 
later life. David L. Smith (2010), for example, identifies the span of years from 
1958 to 1966 during which Watts published the already cited Nature, Man and 
Woman (1958b/1970b), as well as This is IT, and Other Essays on Zen and Spiri- 
tual Experience (1960), Psychotherapy East and West (1961), The Joyous Cosmology: 
Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness (1962a), The Two Hands of God: The 
Myths of Polarity (1963c), Beyond Theology: The Art of Godmanship (1964a), and 
The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are (1966). The works produced 
by Watts during this phase of time, in Smith’s view, “constitute his finest and 
most characteristic achievements” (p. 21). A fourth assessment is offered by 
Oldmeadow (2004) who identifies four texts (Watts, 1953c, 1957, 1961, 1975b) 
interspersed among Watts’ total output reflecting “genuine scholarship . . . rig- 
orous intellectual inquiry . . . [and] substance” (p. 262). 

Finally, and as mentioned previously, Watts is commonly and popularly 
associated with Zen Buddhism. Yet of the 21 major books authored by Watts 
during his lifetime, including the posthumously published Tao: The Watercourse 
Way (1975b), only two texts—The Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art 
in the Far East (1936) and The Way of Zen (1957)—concerned Buddhism per se. 
Most of his works focused on other topics or were much broader in scope, 
with various interdisciplinary emphases informing his particular subject matter. 
Thus in light of concerns about the arc, apex, and focus of Watts’ work, In the 


10 INTRODUCTION 


Academy is structured thematically and ordered chronologically therein. The text 
provides a database for readers to gauge comparisons and contrasts of Watts’ 
developmental trajectories reflected in and across a range of topics, including 
language and mysticism (Part 1), Buddhism and Zen (Part 2), Christianity (Part 
3), comparative religion (Part 4), psychedelics (Part 5), and psychology and 
psychotherapy (Part 6). 


THE WHOLE AND ITS PARTS 


Taken in its entirety In the Academy offers a compelling survey of Watts’ scholarly 
efforts in a variety of pedagogic disciplines. The word “entirety” is here used 
advisedly. The intention is not to totalize the Wattsian corpus nor to suggest 
a complete unification of his work. This book instead brings into focus a col- 
lection of essays that are frequently, though not always, marginalized due to 
Watts’ ubiquitous reputation as a nonacademic writer. The relegation of his 
academic materials to the conversational periphery has been called “the taboo 
against knowing Alan Watts” (Columbus & Rice, 2012b, pp. 4-6). Often upstaging 
Watts’ more learned offerings is a dualistic dialogue of idolatry and iconoclasm 
reverberating in and resounding through conversations about him. Here one set 
of voices articulates and recapitulates Watts’ “popular guru” reputation while 
an iconoclastic and skeptical constituency undercuts the adulation by dismissal 
of him in summary fashion. In the Academy is thus an attempt to add tone and 
volume to some routinely muffled aspects of Alan Watts’ life and work. 


Part 1: LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


The relation of language to mysticism is central to understanding Alan Watts’ 
mystical philosophy, and so the topic serves as a useful point of departure 
toward subsequent sections of the text in hand. Moreover, the role of language 
in structuring, expressing, and understanding first-person mystical experience is 
an ongoing debate within psychology, philosophy, religion and other academic 
specialties (Dible, 2010; Hood, 2012; Tyson, 2013). Two components of the 
debate are relevant here. First is the problem of religious language, that is to say, 
the extent to which human linguistic forms limit, afford, or nullify veridical 
claims about God and mystical transcendence (Reed, 2007; White, 2010). Second 
is the problem of pure consciousness, in other words, the extent to which mystical 
experiences are universally recognized (Forman, 1990, 1998, 1999) or structured 
by culturally determined modes of communication (Katz, 1978, 1983, 1992). 
Though a full accounting of Watts’ position on language, consciousness, and 
mysticism is beyond the scope of the present discussion—see Brannigan (1977, 
1988), Recoulley (1986), and Keightley (1986) for extended coverage—it may 
be said here that Watts employed apophatic and cataphatic languages toward 
expressing and talking about mystical experience (Keightley, 2012). Watts, fur- 


INTRODUCTION 11 


thermore, transitioned from a universal philosophia perennis early in his career 
(e.g., Watts, 1947, 1953c) to hermeneutical analyses of contextual horizons in 
the 1960s and beyond (e.g., Watts, 1966, 1975b; see Columbus, 2012). 

The leadoff essay is a heretofore unpublished and unnamed piece written 
during Watts’ 1950 sabbatical funded by the Franklin J. Matchette Founda- 
tion. Here it is assigned the title “On the Meaning and Relation of Absolute 
and Relative.” Watts suggests that knowledge of what may be called “God” 
or “ultimate Reality” is discovered in the full embrace of finitude rather than 
struggling to flee the relative and finite world. Only through the most thorough 
acceptance of limitations and ignorance can one encounter the “mystery of 
the universe.” Documents contained in the Franklin J. Matchette archive at the 
Wisconsin Historical Society indicate the piece was a work-for-hire modeled 
on Matchette’s (1949) posthumously published Outlines of a Metaphysics. Early 
on, however, Watts radically departed from Matchette’s vision, while adding 
supplementary pedagogic illustrations. In time, the project was terminated 
in favor of grant funding for The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of 
Anxiety (Watts, 1951). 

“The Negative Way” was published during Watts’ first year at the American 
Academy of Asian Studies. It is a brief tutorial on the meaning of “negation” 
in the metaphysics of Vedanta and Buddhism vis-a-vis positive affirmations of 
God in Christianity. The article appeared in the journal of the Vedanta Soci- 
ety of Southern California, Vedanta and the West (Watts, 1951a). The journal 
described Watts’ essay as follows: 


Mr. Watts feels that a meeting of eastern and western religious 
viewpoints must rest upon a better understanding of their respective 
terminologies. He has attempted to help build such an understanding 
with his essay explaining the oriental custom of seeking to portray 
the infinite through negation. (In This Issue, 1951, n.p.) 


“The Language of Metaphysical Experience: The Sense of Non-Sense” is a 
critical appraisal of logical philosophy’s rejection of metaphysics as meaningless 
tautology. The essay was first presented at the 13th Conference on Science, Phi- 
losophy, and Religion held at Columbia University in 1952. (Watts also served as 
a discussant at the meeting. See Bryson, Finkelstein, Maciver, & Mckeon, 1954.) 
Records of the Conference, established in 1940 and continuing until 1968, are 
housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. An archive note reads: 


The conference constituted a response to the rise of totalitarianism 
in Europe. Its founding members [including Paul Tillich, Harold 
D. Lasswell, Franz Boas, Enrico Fermi, and Mortimer J. Adler] and 
their successors sought to create a framework for the preservation 
of democracy and intellectual freedom through the collaboration of 


12 INTRODUCTION 


scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the sciences and humani- 
ties. Conference members, many of whom blamed the development 
of “value-free” scholarship for the rise of European fascism, addition- 
ally hoped to synthesize traditional values and academic scholarship. 
(Historical Note, n.d.) 


Watts’ essay was subsequently published in 1953(b) by the Journal of Religious 
Thought. 

“On Philosophical Synthesis” was published in Philosophy East and West 
(Watts, 1953d) as part of an ongoing series of reflections by eminent thinkers 
of the day (e.g., John Dewey, William Ernest Hocking, George Santayana, and 
D. T. Suzuki) concerning the possibility and viability of intercultural philosophy. 
As Chatterjee noted in 1960: 


The writers of these articles have not only expressed different but 
conflicting views. Some of them have held high hopes for a synthesis, 
or, at least for the significance of a synthesis between the philosophies 
of East and West. Others have contended that a synthesis between the 
two is impossible, and undesirable, too. (p. 99) 


Watts’ essay concerns problems of commensurability between Western philoso- 
phies of logic, and Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism, suggesting the former 
cannot understand the latter without admitting “that philosophy is more than 
logic, more than verbalization, to the point where philosophy can include the 
transformation of the very processes of the mind.” 

Concluding Part 1 is “Philosophy Beyond Words.” Here Watts registers 
critical reflections on philosophy as rationalism, and asserts that philosophers 
can renew their “basic wondering” through embodied engagement and “sensu- 
ous apprehension” of existence. The essay was written circa 1972 and published 
posthumously (Watts, 1975a) in The Owl of Minerva: Philosophers on Philosophy, 
a text surveying perspectives of 18 prominent philosophers, including Karl 
Popper, Gabriel Marcel, Brand Blanchard, W. V. Quine, A. J. Ayer, and Herbert 
Marcuse, concerning the nature and function of contemporary philosophy. Bon- 
tempo and Odell (1975) observe that Watts’ slant in this essay is less historical 
or pragmatic than it is reflective of an “activity approach to philosophy” as 
he objects to emphases placed by many academics on “philosophy as an intel- 
lectual activity” (p. 20). 


PaRT 2: BUDDHISM AND ZEN 
Alan Watts, along with D. T. Suzuki, is considered by historians of religion 


as a prime facilitator of Zen Buddhism for American culture in the twentieth 
century (Queen, Prothero, & Shattuck, 2009, p. 1048; Seager, 2013; Smith, 2010). 


INTRODUCTION 13 


Watts began his studies of Zen in 1930 at the age of 15 while serving under 
the tutorage of a seminal figure of British and European Buddhism, Christmas 
(Toby) Humphreys (1901-1983). Humphreys established the Buddhist Lodge 
in 1924 as an auxiliary to the London office of the Theosophical Society, an 
esoteric religious group founded by Madame H. P. Blavatsky and Henry Steele 
Olcott in 1875. Humphreys later left the Theosophical Society, renamed the 
Lodge as the Buddhist Society, and remained president of the organization until 
his death. Guy (2000) notes that Humphreys, author of 15 books on Buddhism: 


made an important early attempt to take the voluminous history of 
Buddhist teachings and put them in an accessible and coherent form. 
There may be better sources of this information today, but there 
weren't then, and Humphreys is an important transitional figure [in 
the movement of Buddhism from Asia to Europe]. (n.p.) 


Under Humphreys’ mentorship, Watts edited the Lodge’s journal, Buddhism 
in England (now The Middle Way), from 1936 to 1938, and wrote The Spirit of 
Zen (1936). Watts (1973a) later acknowledged: “Even though I now remonstrate, 
mildly, against some of Toby’s interpretations of Buddhism, | shall love him 
always as the man who really set my imagination going and put me on my 
whole way of life” (p. 88). 

After settling in New York City in 1938, Watts came under the sway of 
two formative figures in American Buddhism, Sokei-an Sasaki and Ruth Fuller 
(Everett) Sasaki, about whom he (1973a) wrote: “Much of what I learned from 
Sokei-an and Ruth has so become part of me that I cannot now sort it out” 
(p. 168). Sokei-an Sasaki (1882-1945) was a Zen master in the Rinzai lineage 
of Shokaku Shaku and Soyen Shaku. He is recognized as the first Japanese 
Zen teacher to reside permanently in the United States. Sokei-an founded the 
Buddhist Society of America (now the First Zen Institute of America) in New 
York City in 1930 where he offered private face-to-face teaching, public talks, 
and translated important Buddhist texts into English, including the Record of 
Rinzai, The Platform Sutra, and the Mumonkon made available to Watts for his 
early writings on Zen. Milstead (2014) described Sokei-an as “a vibrantly wise 
and funny man who was eager to take on the challenges of bringing Buddha’s 
ancient teachings on no-self, impermanence, and emptiness to the materialistic, 
noisy, self-centered people of the United States” (p. 213). Watts (1973a) expe- 
rienced Sokei-an as a kindred spirit: “I felt that he was on the same team as 
I; that he bridged the spiritual and the earthy, and that he was as humorously 
earthy as he was spiritually awakened” (p. 168). 

Ruth Fuller (Everett) Sasaki (1892-1967) was second wife of Sokei-an 
Sasaki, mother of Watts’ first wife (Eleanor Everett), and primary patron of 
the First Zen Institute. Ruth studied briefly with D. T. Suzuki in 1930 and with 
Nanshinken Roshi at Kyoto’s Nanzenji monastery in 1932. She met Sokei-an in 


14 INTRODUCTION 


1933, began formal Zen studies with him in 1938, and they married in 1944. 
Ruth moved to Japan in 1949 for further Zen training, becoming in 1958 the first 
Westerner (and only woman) to be a priest of a Rinzai Zen Buddhist temple. 
Founder of the First Zen Institute of America in Japan, she was instrumental 
in facilitating translations of important Buddhist texts into English (Stirling, 
2006). Her book, Zen Dust, coauthored with Isshu Miura, “remains the single- 
most important English-language introduction to koan study in the Japanese 
manner” (Ford, 2006, p. 70). 

Watts published two major books on Zen Buddhism during his lifetime: 
The Spirit of Zen (1936) and The Way of Zen (1957). The former text, though 
often criticized as simply derivative of D. T. Suzuki's work, was according to 
Humphreys (1994) “the first major attempt by a Westerner to write on the 
subject” (p. 15). The latter text was an important milestone for the field of 
Buddhist Studies in that Watts challenged D. T. Suzuki’s ahistorical narratives 
by locating Zen within a temporal-developmental trajectory (Hurvitz, 1958; 
McCarthy, 1957). Praised by Soto Zen teacher, Shunryu Suzuki, as “a great 
Bodhisattva” (Chadwick, 1999, p. 381), Watts’ writings and lectures framed the 
American conversation about Zen from the 1950s into the 1970s (Smith, 2010; 
Swearer, 1973). Yet the prominent status of Watts within twentieth-century 
American Buddhism is not without ambiguity and skepticism. Watts, for example, 
was criticized for not gaining firsthand experiences of Buddhism in Asia until 
1961, after writing his major texts on Zen (Ballantyne, 1989; see Watts, 1973a, 
pp. 417-453, for a narrative account of his journeys to Japan). Also, the late 
Philip Kapleau (1912-2004), a teacher in the Sanbo Kyodon tradition of Zen, 
and Louis Nordstrom who continues teaching in the White Plum lineage of 
Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi, charged Watts with misinterpreting certain historical 
aspects of Zen Buddhism, and misjudging the value of zazen (Kapleau, 1966, 
pp. 21-22, 83-84; Nordstrom & Pilgrim, 1980). However, see Watts (1975b, p. 
89n15) for a brief reply to Kapleau (1966), and see Columbus (1985) for a reply 
to Nordstrom and Pilgrim (1980). 

In the twenty-first century, four perspectives on Watts in relation to Bud- 
dhism are noticeable. One critical view is that Watts’ writings are informed by 
idealized and stereotyped constructions of “the East” which compromise their 
ecological validity (Iwamura, 2011). Second is the view that Watts arrogated 
Buddhism and constructed a philosophical commodity for consumption by an 
American constituency alienated from Cold War politics (Matsatsugu, 2008). 
Third is that Watts was signaling an Occidentalism, that is to say, he converted 
extant Japanese appraisals of American rationalism and materialism into thera- 
peutic critiques of Cold War culture in America (Brown, 2009). Finally, Watts 
is seen as proffering a “modern Buddhism” that is divergent from tradition, 
but congruent with the spiritual sensibilities of contemporary Western life 
(Lopez, 2002; McMahan, 2008). (A fifth perspective relating Buddhist practice 
to a psychedelic ethos is identified in Part 5.) 


INTRODUCTION 15 


The six writings by Alan Watts here compiled under the rubric of Bud- 
dhism and Zen were published between 1941 and 1963. The initial essay is 
“The Problem of Faith and Works in Buddhism.” This 1941 article, written for 
Columbia University’s Review of Religion, was the first-ever academic journal 
article by Watts. The essay is an exploration of self-reliance (jiriki) and spiritual 
conviction (tariki) in their relationship to Enlightenment in Mahayana Buddhism. 
As Watts (1973a) recounted in his autobiography, the essay had “momentous 
consequences” as it presaged his perennialist approach to Christianity: 


Isaw that . . . Zen, Jodo Shinshu, and Christianity were all approaching 
the same point by different routes. It might thus be possible to develop 
a deeper and more intelligible form of Christianity which would, how- 
ever, have to bypass that religion’s . . . claims [to exclusivity]. (p. 177) 


The second writing, dedicated to Ruth Fuller Sasaki and simply titled 
“Zen,” is an introductory tutorial on (1) the historical background of Zen in 
Indian and Chinese religion, (2) the influence of Daoism on Buddhism, (3) the 
role of mondo, zazen, and koans in Zen practice, and (4) the cultural effects of 
Zen in Japan. The essay was an invited lecture to the Department of Religion 
at Beloit College in 1945, and subsequently revised and expanded in 1948 as a 
corrective update for The Spirit of Zen (1936). In a foreword to the essay, Watts 
(1948) noted his indebtedness to D. T. Suzuki and Sokei-an Sasaki for their 
English translations of Zen texts, and to Ruth Fuller Sasaki who provided and 
discussed with Watts various transcriptions of lectures by Sokei-an. 

“The Way of Liberation in Zen Buddhism” was the first contribution 
to the short-lived Asian Study Monographs series, published by the American 
Academy of Asian Studies (AAAS) in 1955. Located at the intersection of Bud- 
dhism and psychology, the essay is an elucidation of how Zen practitioners 
resolve conflictual paradox into unity (nonduality). A preliminary to both The 
Way of Zen and Psychotherapy East and West, Watts wrote the essay in light of 
his consultations on Gregory Bateson’s double-bind communication research 
(see Pickering, 2011), publishing it one year before Bateson, Jackson, Haley, and 
Weakland (1956) published their classic essay, “Toward a Theory of Schizo- 
phrenia.” Watts’ monograph is yet another example in which he was one step 
ahead of the cutting-edge thinkers of his era. A review in Manas described the 
essay as “the kind of thinking that may result when psychological problems 
and questions are approached with philosophical conviction and commitment” 
(Study of the Mind, 1955). 

Next is the famous 1958(a) Chicago Review essay on “Beat Zen, Square 
Zen, and Zen,” based on a series of lectures given by Watts at the University 
of Chicago in 1957. The article is a critical appraisal of problematic appropria- 
tions of Zen Buddhism in Judeo-Christian culture, and thus anticipates a genre 
of postmodern scholarship that deconstructs European and North American 


16 INTRODUCTION 


approaches to Asian cultures and histories toward uncovering hidden assump- 
tions and biases. Due to Mahoney’s (1958) erroneous impression that Watts 
sided with the “squares,” the essay was subsequently twice revised, first as a 
tract for Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s City Lights Books, then as chapter in This is 
It, and Other Essays on Zen and Spiritual Experience (Watts, 1960). 

“Zen and Politics” is a 1962(c) commentary on political implications of 
Buddhist ethics. Published in New Politics: A Journal of Socialist Thought, this 
brief essay is a rebuttal to Braun’s (1961) “The Politics of Zen.” Braun argued 
that Zen Buddhism, including Watts’ (1958, 1960) work, is a “mysticism that 
denies the reality of moral choice” and therefore supports problematic states 
of affairs “with dogmatic certainty” (p. 188), including, for example, World War 
II atrocities. Watts rejoins that Braun’s is a fallacious argument that confuses 
categorically the moral ends of Christianity with the practice of Zen (see also, 
Braun’s 1962 response). The debate foreshadows later controversies concerning 
the role of Zen in Japan during World War II. See, for example, Victoria (2003, 
2006) and the reply by Sato (2008). 

The final essay on Buddhism and Zen is Watts’ 1963(b) “Prefatory Essay” 
written for a reissue of D. T. Suzuki’s Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism. Suzuki, 
as is well-known, was a formative influence on Watts’ early thinking about Zen. 
See, for example, Watts’ (1967) reminiscence in the wake of Suzuki’s death 
(see also, Watts’ brief 1954 review of Suzuki’s works). In the present essay, 
Watts identifies and elaborates consistencies between Mahayana Buddhism and 
certain strains of thought in twentieth-century science and philosophy. Beyond 
any consistencies, however, Watts suggests the main contribution of Mahayana 
Buddhism to Western culture is that, with committed Buddhist practice, one 
realizes “the compassion of one who knows that, in some way, all suffering is his 
own suffering, and all ‘sentient beings’ the disguises of his own inmost nature.” 


ParT 3: CHRISTIANITY 


Alan Watts’ religious discernment and spiritual formation within the Church of 
England and the wider Anglican Communion are often overshadowed by his 
prevalent association with Zen Buddhism. Nurtured in a devout Anglo-Catholic 
family and educated at the kindergarten school of Saint Nicholas Church in 
Chislehurst (1921-1922), Saint Hugh’s School in Bickley (1922-1928), and King’s 
School at Canterbury (1928-1932), Watts “had been immersed in the Anglican 
tradition from birth until his late teens to a degree that is hardly imaginable 
today” (Keightley, 2012, p. 44; see Watts, 1973a, pp. 53-121, for autobiographi- 
cal reflections on his Anglican upbringing). After relocating to New York City, 
Watts accepted spiritual direction from Fr. Grieg Taber at the Episcopal Church 
of Saint Mary the Virgin before enrolling at Seabury-Western Theological 
Seminary in Evanston, Illinois in 1941. Sans an undergraduate degree, Watts 
was admitted to the Seminary as a “special student” in the graduate school, 


INTRODUCTION 17 


on the strength of his previous reading, research, and writing (e.g., Watts, 
1936, 1937, 1940). After one year of class attendance, he spent his remaining 
two years of seminary engaging tutorials and independent study where, Watts 
(1973a) recounts, he: 


combed through Patristics, reading Clement and Origen, the remains 
of the Gnostic writings, Saint Athanasius, Saint Irenaeus, Saint Gregory 
Nazianzus, Saint John of Damascus, and the apocryphal literature 
excluded from the New Testament. Then I went heavily into Russian 
theology—Solovyev, Berdyaev, Bulgakov, and the Hesychasts—and 
thereafter became fascinated with the architectural magnificence of 
Saint Thomas Aquinas and his modern interpreters, Jacques Maritain 
and Etienne Gilson. 

There followed mystical and ascetic theology: almost all the clas- 
sics from Saint Dionysius to Leon Bloy, as well as the historians and 
commentators, Bremond, Underhill, von Hugel. Inge, Dom Cuthbert 
Butler, Dom John Chapman, and Garrigou-Lagrange. (pp. 206-207) 


Watts received the Sacrament of Holy Orders on the Feast of the Ascension, 
May 18, 1944, and subsequently obtained a master’s degree in sacred theology 
from Seabury-Western in 1948. After his 1944 ordination and until his resignation 
from the Church in 1950, Watts served Bishop Wallace Conklin of Chicago as 
examining chaplain for candidates seeking Holy Orders, while also stationed as 
priest, theologian, and spiritual counselor at Canterbury House, located on the 
grounds of Northwestern University. Watts rapidly became a rising star on the 
Northwestern University campus. According to Ellwood (1997): 


Canterbury House was the scene of nonstop bull sessions and unforget- 
table lectures in which Watts, as always, managed to make his listen- 
ers feel they were being let in on some wonderful cosmic secret. His 
Sunday liturgical enactments had the color of great theater and the 
mood of playful dance more than of courtly rite. (p. 169) 


The signature accomplishments by Watts as priest and theologian are the 
publications of Behold the Spirit (1947) and The Supreme Identity (1950). The for- 
mer text was lauded by reviewers for exposing neglect of Christian mysticism 
in mid-twentieth-century theological study and practice of Anglo-Catholicism 
and Protestantism (Akhilananda, 1948; Gowen, 1949; Steere, 1949). The latter 
text, considered by the Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers as “probably 
his most substantial work of scholarship and sustained, serious philosophical 
discourse” (Ellwood, 2005, p. 2539), was praised for its contributions to con- 
structive dialogue between Christian and non-Christian religions (Keene, 1952; 
Morris, 1951; Waterhouse, 1953). 


18 INTRODUCTION 


Part 3 of In the Academy contains four writings on Christianity published 
in the mid-1940s during Watts’ tenure as an Episcopal priest. They were writ- 
ten prior to the publication of Behold the Spirit (1947) and are preliminary to 
that text as each essay concerns an aspect of mystical union between God and 
humanity. The initial offering is Watts’ 1944 translation of “Theologia Mystica, 
being the treatise of Saint Dionysius pseudo-Areopagite on Mystical Theology, 
together with the first and fifth Epistles.” “With few exceptions,” Watts (1944) 
noted in a Foreword, the translation “follows the text given in Migne’s Patro- 
logiae Graecae, vol. 3. This text has been compared with the earliest version, 
by John Scotus Erigena, in Migne’s Patrologaie Latinae, vol. 122.” Published as 
a monograph by Holy Cross Press, Watts begins with an introductory tutorial 
on the apophatic approach to mysticism and mystical experience. 

In “The Case for God,” Watts establishes the premise that God is revealed in 
the world through evidence of the senses and reasoned argument. He suggests 
“it is not presumptuous to attempt to prove the existence of God by reason. 
It is, on the contrary, the duty of reason and the chief purpose for which this 
faculty is given us.” Watts offers details of the five proofs of God as described 
by St. Thomas in Summa Theologica, and considers what the evidence for God 
suggests about God’s nature. Three particularly significant facets of divine 
nature deduced from reason via human experience are identified: God is life, 
God is being, and God is love. The essay was published by Holy Cross Press 
in the Roodcroft Papers series in 1946(a). 

Next is “The Meaning of Priesthood” in light of Anglo-Catholicism. The 
essay was published in 1946(c) in Advent Papers, a monograph series inaugurated 
in 1943 by Boston’s Church of the Advent, with an editorial board including, 
most notably, philosopher John D. Wild, psychologist Gordon W. Allport, and 
theologians John B. Coburn and Adelaide T. Case. An advertisement in The Liv- 
ing Church describes the series as “designed to bring to our people the richness 
and depth of traditional Catholic Christianity as it has been preserved in our 
free and democratic Anglican Catholicism.” Watts, the ad continues, “writes 
comprehensively though compactly of the priestly function—it’s setting in the 
church’s history and teaching, its work, its opportunities and privileges, and 
also its problems” (The Advent Papers, 1946, p. 5). 

The final writing on Christianity is “The Christian Doctrine of Marriage.” 
Watts suggests that “Holy Matrimony is the highest earthly analogy of that 
creative union of God and man, Christ and Church, which is the end and ful- 
fillment of human life.” First differentiating Agape love from erotic love, Watts 
then follows-up with practical applications of Agape love to three realms of 
marriage: body, mind, and spirit. The monograph was published in 1946(b) as 
a Canterbury Club Tract by the Episcopal Church at the University of Colorado- 
Boulder. Note that Watts, as an Anglican priest in 1946, was referring in this 
piece to marriages between men and women. See Watts (1979) for his later 
perspective on gay and lesbian relationships. 


INTRODUCTION 19 


Part 4: COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


Alan Watts was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Divinity from the University 
of Vermont in 1958 for “scholarly contributions marking him as one of our country’s 
outstanding authorities on comparative religion” (Dykhuizen & Borgmann, 1958, p. 
1, italics added). Indeed, beyond his studies of Buddhism and Christianity per 
se, “comparative religion” may best echo the overarching tenor of Watts’ writ- 
ings and lectures. His early comparative thinking was informed by a philosophia 
perennis with a priori assumptions that religion and spirituality transcend exoteric 
contingencies of culture and context toward esoteric and universal realms of 
mystical experience (Watts, 1947, 1950, 1951b, 1953c). As Watts (1973) explained 
in his autobiography, by adopting the approach of perennial philosophy “one 
could go behind the screen of literal dogma to the inner meaning of symbols, 
to the level at which Eckhart and Shankara, Saint Teresa and Ramakrishna, Saint 
Dionysius and Nagarjuna are talking the same language” (p. 180). 

Watts’ early philosophia perennis was, no doubt, influenced in part by Christ- 
mas Humphrey’s theosophical leanings (Sutcliffe, 2007, p. 61) and, perhaps most 
notably, by the tutorage from 1934 to 1936 of Serbian philosopher Dimitrije 
Mitrinovic (1887-1953). A formative thinker in the pre-World War I Young Bos- 
nia movement and subsequent New Europe Group and New Britain Movement 
(Rigby, 2006), Mitrinovic integrated mystical metaphysics and transformative 
political-social philosophy (Rutherford, 1987). Watts (1973a) especially recounts 
a discourse by Mitrinovic “in which he explained the complementation of the 
principle of unity and the principle of differentiation in the universe. . . . He 
showed me that acute differences positively manifest unity, and that you cannot 
have the one without the other” (p. 126). There is, in other words, “the mutual 
interdependence of all things and events (p. 126). 

In the 1960s Watts transitioned away from perennial philosophy as a point 
of departure for comparative religion. Spurring the transition was a rising tide of 
relativistic thinking in academic discourse, including postmodernism and social 
constructionism, which challenged the veracity of absolutistic and universalistic 
epistemological claims. In this way of thinking, people are embedded in their 
particular situations—culture, history, gender, language, education, spiritual 
practice—which makes it difficult for them to entirely comprehend differing 
religious systems and texts without the distorting effects of bias and prejudice. 
Seeking to overcome the limited vision of contextualized knowledge, Watts 
(1963c, 1964a, 1966, 1975b) turned toward hermeneutical analyses exploring 
interconnections and disjunctions between localized narratives. Through this 
kind of interpretive study, one arrives at an expanded awareness and compre- 
hension of perspectives via the dialectical rotation of differing vantage points. 

Four texts are excellent examples of Watts’ hermeneutical turn in the 
1960s and beyond. First is Psychotherapy East and West (Watts, 1961/1969) in 
which Watts engaged transcultural comparisons between (1) psychotherapy and 


20 INTRODUCTION 


(2) Buddhism, Daoism, and Hinduism toward uncovering the “philosophical 
unconscious” of Western therapeutic systems (Columbus, 2015b). In Beyond 
Theology (1964) and The Book (1966), Watts employed hermeneutical rules of 
analysis to explore horizons of self and cosmos (Columbus, 2012). Watts’ final 
book, Tao: The Watercourse Way (1975), is an exploration of historical, cultural, 
and personal horizons vis-a-vis contemplative Daoism. Watts’ analysis is a his- 
torical hermeneutic in that he seeks to understand what the “far-off echoes” 
of fifth- and fourth-century B.C. Daoism mean to the contemporary state of 
affairs. The analysis is a cultural hermeneutic in that he seeks to “interpret 
and clarify the principles of Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, and Lieh-tzu” in relation to 
Euro-American thinking. The text also is a personal hermeneutic because, 
writes Watts, “I am... interested in how these ancient writings reverberate 
on the harp of my own brain, which has, of course, been tuned to the scales 
of Western culture” (p. xvi). Note, however, that Watts was roundly criticized 
by perennial philosophers for his transition to hermeneutics. Vis-a-vis Beyond 
Theology, for example, Perry (1972), rejoined: 


Watts... sets forth the pattern of this transition in Beyond Theol- 
ogy ..., a crazy pastiche of esoteric insights and false deductions, 
yet typically symptomatic of the ills to which so much of the pseudo- 
spiritual flesh of our times is heir. (p. 176) 


The quartet of essays on comparative religion contained in Part 4 were 
initially presented at various symposia in the 1960s during Watts’ hermeneutic 
phase, and subsequently published in an assortment of academic venues. “Wor- 
ship in Sacrament and Silence” was offered in 1964 at the third Symposium 
on Human Values, an annual conference hosted by Central Washington State 
College. The 1964 symposium theme centered on the meaning of worship. 
Juxtaposing Christian worship with Hindu epistemology, Watts explored vari- 
ous themes and variations on the sacred character of communal liturgy. The 
presentation was published (Watts, 1971b) in the symposia proceedings, A College 
Looks at American Values, Vol. 1, edited by E. H. Odell. 

In “Western Mythology: Its Dissolution and Transformation,” Watts explores 
some experiential implications of paradigmatic transitions away from patriarchal- 
theistic myths of Judeo-Christianity toward Newtonian-mechanistic myths of 
natural science, and finally to quantum physics. The piece was presented at a 
1968 symposium on “Myth and Dream” sponsored by the Society for the Arts, 
Religion, and Contemporary Culture, “a multi-disciplinary professional society 
which provides the occasion and the resources for bringing together persons 
from diverse professional backgrounds to consider basic issues of human con- 
flict and community” (Society, 1970, p. 6). The essay was published (Watts, 
1970b) in the symposium proceedings, edited by Joseph Campbell, titled Myths, 
Dreams, and Religion. 


INTRODUCTION Zi 


“The Future of Religion” was presented at a 1968 lecture series on “human 
values in a technological society” at Stanford University. The speakers were 
urged to consider and offer new paradigmatic norms for the approaching new 
century vis-a-vis the individual, technology, and society. Essays of the lecture 
series were published in Toward Century 21: Technology, Society, and Human Val- 
ues, edited by C. S. Wallia. In a foreword to the text, psychologist Ernest R. 
Hilgard (1970) wrote: 


If this book does nothing else than give us a sense of choice, it will 
have served its purpose; for if we are free to choose, we shall cer- 
tainly make our choice for a better world for those who will follow 
after us. (p. xii) 


Watts (1970a) chose to consider the influx of Buddhist, Daoist, and Hindu 
mysticisms into American culture, and their future bearing on Christian rela- 
tionships to God. 

The final work on comparative religion, “Unity in Contemplation,” was 
given at Word Out of Silence: A Symposium on World Spiritualities, sponsored 
by the Center for Spiritual Studies and held at Mount Saviour Monastery in 
1972. Symposium essays were published in a 1974 issue of Cross Currents. Sym- 
posium editor, John-David Robinson (1974), called the venture “an invitation to 
the ‘one-world spirituality’ emerging in our time” (p. 133). Watts’ (1974b) essay 
served to explore the paradox of human limitation as the juncture for spiritual 
insight. He contended that methods and practices of religious mysticism, either 
Eastern or Western, are designed to bring individuals to their human spiritual 
limits where Divine Wisdom is encountered. For discussion of Watts’ essay, see 
“Responses to Alan Watts” (1974). 


Part 5: PSYCHEDELICS 


The Current Biography Yearbook (Moritz, 1963) described Alan Watts as a philoso- 
pher exploring the catalytic impact of Buddhism, Daoism, and Hinduism in the 
West. This description of Watts is perhaps most apt in relation to his writings 
on psychedelics where he integrated natural and social science field theory with 
Hindu mythology and Zen Buddhism toward understanding mystical implica- 
tions of psychoactive substances such as LSD and psilocybin. According to the 
New Westminster Dictionary of Christian Spirituality, Watts was “one of the most 
important and influential writers” on the relations of psychedelics and spiritual 
growth in the 1960s (Leech, 2005, p. 255). As Krippner (2012) explains, the pre- 
vailing behaviorist, neobehaviorist, and psychoanalytic paradigms of the 1950s 
and 1960s were unequipped to handle altered modes of awareness inherent to 
psychedelic experiences beyond the categories of pathology and disorder. Watts, 
among others, offered nuanced phenomenological and interpretive accounts 


22 INTRODUCTION 


providing “optimistic and comprehensive” perspectives on psychedelic experi- 
ences while also legitimating their ontological status. 

Between 1958 and 1963 Watts participated in four psychopharmacological 
studies on psychedelics, including research at the University of California-Los 
Angeles; the Langley-Porter Psychiatric Institute at the University of California 
San Francisco Medical Center; University of California—tIrvine; and Timothy 
Leary’s Psychedelic Research Project at Harvard University’s Center for Person- 
ality Research where he served also as an editorial advisor to The Psychedelic 
Review. Based on these studies and his own personal experiments, Watts’ per- 
spective on the relations of psychedelics to spiritual growth evolved over time, 
from skepticism (1958/1970, p. 78n11) to mild enthusiasm (Watts, 1960/1973b, 
1962a), and, finally, to guarded optimism (Watts, 1973a). 

Reactions to Watts’ writings on psychedelics were of a binary sort. He 
was, on one hand, lauded for his qualitative descriptions and interpretations 
of psychedelic experience (Gorham, 1963; Leary & Alpert 1962/1970; Metzner, 
1968) as they proved valuable for revising psychological understandings of 
human affect (Collier, 1966) and personality (Unger, 1963). On the other hand, 
he was criticized for misinterpreting ego regression as ego transcendence (Gordon, 
1970; Rascke, 1980), and for reifying Hindu and Buddhist interpretations of 
psychedelic experience (Masters & Houston, 1966). Watts’ qualitative work on 
psychedelics nevertheless remains pertinent as archival data for theory, pedagogy, 
and research (Fadiman, 2011; Grof, 1988; Merkur, 1998; Slattery, 2011), and in 
contemporary analyses of psychedelic experience in relation to psychospiritual 
narratives (Dickins, 2012; Kripal, 2007), Buddhist practice (Cunningham, 2007), 
and postmodern thinking (Fuller, 2000; Shipley, 2012). 

Part 5 centers on a group of four essays concerning psychedelics written 
by Watts between 1963 and 1971. The first essay, “The Individual as Man/ 
World,” is an elaboration of commensurability between organism-environment 
field theory and subjective mystical experiences of nonduality. The essay was 
offered as a colloquium presentation to the Department of Social Relations at 
Harvard University on April 12, 1963, and published in the inaugural issue of 
The Psychedelic Review (Watts, 1963a). A Review editorial (1963) notes: “Philo- 
sophical studies exploring the epistemological and metaphysical implications 
of increased flexibility of consciousness are needed. Alan Watts’ essay on the 
philosophical problems arising out of the possibility of increased control of the 
mind delineates one of the major themes” (p. 4). 

The next essay is titled “A Psychedelic Experience: Fact or Fantasy?” Here 
Watts critically appraises psychiatric nomenclature on psychedelics, describes 
the phenomenology of psychedelic experience, and considers the implications 
of the experience in light of field theory and Hindu philosophy. The essay 
was written and published per the invitation of David Solomon for his edited 
volume on LSD: The Consciousness-Expanding Drug (Watts, 1964b). Cohen (1965) 
described Watts’ essay as “an illuminating article” that “finds Watts consolidat- 


INTRODUCTION 23 


ing his previous thinking and successfully shaking-up the psychiatric cosmology, 
always a salutary exercise.” Watts, Cohen continued, “exposes all too well those 
acceptable myths which we, in our time-bound existence, label as truths, and 
our unfortunate descriptions of what is culturally unacceptable in terms of 
disease or aberration” (p. 408). 

In “Psychedelics and Religious Experience,” Watts describes qualities of 
consciousness evoked by psychedelic substances, and discusses objections to their 
use which, he suggests, arise mainly from disjunctions between the values of 
the mystical counterculture and the conventional, secular and religious standards 
of Western society. The essay was presented at the National Symposium on 
Psychedelic Drugs and Marijuana sponsored by the Illinois State Medical Soci- 
ety in cooperation with the American Medical Association in April 1968, and 
published in the same year by California Law Review (Watts, 1968) in a special 
issue on drugs and the law. 

The final essay on psychedelics is titled “Ordinary Mind is the Way.” In 
this brief essay, Watts describes and comments on four distinct stages in the 
temporal-phenomenological trajectory of a psychedelic experience. Alluding 
tacitly to Case 19 of The Mumonkon (see, e.g., Shibayama, 1974), Watts suggests 
that “ordinary consciousness is the supreme form of awakening.” The essay was 
included in a literary symposium on “Drugs and Buddhism” published by The 
Eastern Buddhist (Watts, 1971a), including essays by D. T. Suzuki, Ray Jordan, 
Ueda Shizutsu, Richard Leavitt, and Robert Aitken. Cunningham (2007) notes 
the symposium marked a somewhat official divide between the psychedelic 
community and Zen Buddhists, as most of the essays argued that psychedelics 
were an obstacle, rather than an aid, to Buddhist practice. 


ParT 6: PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


Alan Watts was a trailblazer in humanistic and transpersonal psychologies. 
The legacy of Asia and Western Man (Watts, 1937) and The Meaning of Happiness 
(Watts, 1940) were among the earliest texts exploring relations between modern 
psychology and wisdom traditions of Asia. Watts’ early psychological writings 
were inspired by the tutorage (1936-1938) of psychiatrist Eric Graham Howe 
(1896-1975), a cofounder of the famous Tavistock Clinic. Howe remarkably 
integrated spiritual practice and existential-phenomenology into psychoanalysis 
and psychotherapy, controversial moves in the early decades of the twentieth 
century (Stranger, 2012). Watts attended weekly discussions at Howe’s Harley 
Street office. The meetings included Richard Arman Gregory, an astronomy 
professor of the University of London; Philip Metman, a Dutch psychiatrist 
and eventual founding member of the Society of Analytical Psychology in 
London who “seemed to understand everything about dreams and symbolism 
(Watts, 1973a, p. 132); and Frederic Spiegelberg, an Asian Studies scholar and 
philosopher who later hired Watts at the American Academy of Asian Studies 


24 INTRODUCTION 


in 1951. Watts (1973a) wrote of his relationship with Howe: “I was not his 
patient. He was simply a genial, dignified, and reassuring doctor who let me 
in on his mind” (p. 131). 

While stationed at the American Academy of Asian Studies (1951-1957), 
Watts was among the first mid-twentieth-century thinkers offering courses and 
colloquia on psychology beyond the conventional models of psychoanalysis 
and behaviorism. The American Academy of Asian Studies, predecessor of the 
California Institute of Integral Studies, was founded in 1951 via financial back- 
ing from entrepreneur Louis Gainsborough as “the first graduate school in the 
United States exclusively devoted to a study of Asia” (Subbiondo, 2011, p. 12). 
In addition to Watts (who served as Dean of the Academy from 1953 to 1956), 
faculty included Frederic Spiegelberg, Haridas Chaudhuri, C. P. Ramaswamy 
Aiyar, Judith Tyberg, Tokwan Tada, and Rom Landau. According to Watts 
(1973a), “we were concerned with the practical transformation of conscious- 
ness, with the actual living out of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist ways of 
life at the level of high mysticism” (p. 286). Subbiondo (2011) notes: “Through 
his scholarly reputation and personal connections, Watts positioned the Acad- 
emy to be a principle meeting place for artists, writers, teachers, activists and 
practitioners of the emerging counter-culture movement of the San Francisco 
Renaissance” (p. 12). Moreover, Subbiondo points out, “Watts played a critical 
role in developing the Academy’s weekly colloquia that attracted many of San 
Francisco’s leading . . . psychotherapists and scholars as well as visiting guests 
like D. T. Suzuki” (p. 12). 

Moreover, Watts advised Gregory Bateson’s research team concerning 
their revolutionary studies on communicational paradox (Pickering, 2011), and 
he expanded the famous “double-bind theory” to cosmic levels of analysis 
(e.g., Watts, 1961, 1964, 1966). His Psychotherapy East and West (Watts, 1961), 
considered foundational to the emergence of transpersonal psychology (Ban- 
kart, 2003), has been called “possibly one of the most influential texts of the 
American psychotherapeutic counterculture” (Taylor, 2003, p. 185; see also, 
Columbus, 2015b). Watts presented the first-ever seminar at Esalen Institute in 
January 1962, thereby launching what became known as the Human Potential 
Movement. He was, finally, a founding editorial board member of the Journal 
of Transpersonal Psychology in 1969, and his applications of phenomenological 
modes of analysis (e.g., Watts, 1951b, 1966) anticipated later methodological 
developments in humanistic and transpersonal psychology (Columbus, 2012). 

Part 6 contains seven writings by Watts on psychology and psychotherapy. 
The first essay, published in the American Journal of Psychoanalysis (Watts, 1953a), 
is “Asian Psychology and Modern Psychiatry.” The piece contains preliminary, 
large-scale reflections on the similarities and differences between (1) Buddhism, 
Hinduism, Daoism, and (2) Western psychiatry, psychotherapy and transforma- 
tions of mind. The essay is informed by an experimental seminar on “The 
Application of Asian Psychology to Modern Psychiatry” conducted by Watts in 


INTRODUCTION 25 


collaboration with Frederic Spiegelberg and Haridas Chaudhuri at the American 
Academy of Asian Studies in 1951. 

In “Convention, Conflict, and Liberation: Further Observations on Asian 
Psychology and Modern Psychiatry,” Watts considers processes of acculturation 
and psychological emancipation as understood through the lens of psychiatry 
in the West, Hinduism in India, and Daoism in China. Watts elaborates several 
conflicts arising out of socialization processes and cultural expectations in the 
West, while noting that certain “Asian societies provide optional means for 
relieving people of the warping effects of their acculturation and upbringing, 
which give them inward liberation (moksha) from the conventions which they 
have been compelled to learn.” The essay was published in the American Journal 
of Psychoanalysis in 1956. 

“Eternity as the Unrepressed Body” is a 1959 book review of Norman O. 
Brown’s Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical Meaning of History. Watts describes 
and elaborates Brown’s effort as a meta-analysis of Freud’s psychoanalytic 
theory—a sort of “psychoanalysis of psychoanalysis’—while adding his own 
critique of Freud into the mix. Freud, Watts suggests, “was at heart a moralist 
who, despite his brilliant diagnosis, did not like what he found and could not 
bring himself to that love of his own nature which would be the necessary 
condition for reconciling man to himself.” The review was published in Etc: A 
Review of General Semantics. 

“Oriental and Occidental Approaches to the Nature of Man” is a brief 
comparative analysis of Anglo-Saxon Protestant and Daoist views on human 
nature, values, and morality. The paper was part of “A Symposium on Human 
Values” organized by Lawrence N. Solomon of the Western Behavioral Sciences 
Institute at the 1961 meeting of the California State Psychological Association, 
and published by the Journal of Humanistic Psychology (Watts, 1962a). Other 
papers of the human values symposium were offered by Charlotte Buhler, 
Herbert Fingarette, and Wolfgang Lederer. See Maslow (1962) for commentary. 

In “The Woman in Man,” Watts outlines aspects of patriarchal culture pre- 
venting recognition and appreciation by men of sensibilities typically labeled as 
“feminine.” He then considers “masculinity” and “femininity” with reference to 
their adaptive value for men and women. The paper was presented at a forum 
on “The Spectrum of Femininity” conducted at the Third Symposium on Man 
and Civilization hosted by the University of California San Francisco Medical 
Center in January 1963, and published in The Potential of Woman, edited by 
Seymour M. Farber and Roger H. L. Wilson (Watts, 1963d). For a panel discus- 
sion of Watts’ presentation plus other papers in “The Spectrum of Femininity” 
forum, see Pribram, Howe, Money, and Watts (1963). 

“An Interview with Alan Watts” was published in a 1969 issue of Existential 
Psychiatry. The conversation, with Philip D. Ungerer, managing editor of the 
journal, covers three primary subjects. The first topic concerns the relations 
of human alienation and technological development as expressed in ecological 


26 INTRODUCTION 


degradation and war. The second topic covers the state of clinical psychiatry 
circa 1969. Third, Watts expounds on the political and social upheavals afflict- 
ing America in the 1960s. 

The final essay is “Psychotherapy and Eastern Religion: Metaphysical Bases 
of Psychiatry.” Watts considers intellectual assumptions underlying Western 
psychotherapy affecting the understanding, fear and acceptance of death. 
Ironically, the essay was given as an invited address at Forest Hospital in Des 
Plains, Illinois, in January 1973. It was the month of his birth, in the year of 
his death. Watts had been living with a problematic heart condition, and may 
have known of his deteriorating health. The essay was published posthumously 
in the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology (Watts, 1974a). 


ALAN WATTS RECONSIDERED 


In the Academy offers a compendium of 30 writings and lectures by Alan Watts. 
The materials are divided among six pedagogic themes, including language and 
mysticism; Buddhism and Zen; Christianity; comparative religion; psychedelics; 
and psychology and psychotherapy. As the text marks the centenary of Watts’ 
birth and serves to commemorate his life and work, it also allows an oppor- 
tunity to reconsider the three epithets—popularizer, guru, and philosophical 
entertainer—commonly attached to his legacy. Each of the labels seems at first 
glance to reinforce the familiar theme that Alan Watts was a writer for the 
masses but not for the scholar. The popularity of Watts’ books and lectures 
among general audiences cannot be denied, and some contemporary thinkers 
suggest the sustained salience over decades of the popularizer label on Watts 
may be due, not only to his literary acumen and charismatic personality, but 
also to the wide variety of media platforms extending his work beyond self- 
selecting readers and listeners (Iwamura, 2011; Siff, 2015). Also irrefutable is 
that the “popularizer” label affixed to Watts often holds pejorative connotations 
for academic specialists who view the accessibility and broad appeal of his writ- 
ings as inherently compromising of scholarly rigor. Yet, as Roszak (1969/1995) 
observed, “too often such aristocratic stricture comes from those who have 
risen above popularization by the device of restricting themselves to a subject 
matter that preserves its purity only because it has no conceivable relevance to 
anything beyond the interests of a small circle of experts” (p. 133). 

An alternative understanding of the “popularizer” epithet attached to Watts 
is illuminated in light of the present text. Without belaboring the point, a case 
can be made that Watts was a polymath inhabiting the interfacial margins of 
disparate academic disciplines—as between religion and psychology, Buddhist 
studies and theology, or philosophy and psychopharmacology—toward afford- 
ing conversations between the specialists working in these and other fields of 
study. He was attempting, then, to employ a nomenclature accessible to scholars 
regardless of their pedagogic disciplines in order to stimulate between-group 


INTRODUCTION 27 


exchange. The epigraph at the beginning of this introduction supports such a 
conclusion, and it bears repeating here: 


As in some economies the rich keep getting richer and the poor poorer, 
so in the overspecialized disciplines of modern scholarship the learned 
get more learned and the ignorant get more ignorant—until the two 
classes can hardly talk to each other. I have dedicated my work to an 
attempt to bridge that gap. (Watts, 1975b, p. xx) 


The “guru” tag on Watts is likewise ripe for reconsideration. Here again, 
the epithet is usually employed in reference to the undeniable fact that popular 
audiences found, and continue to find, his writings valuable to their spiritual 
and intellectual lives. Watts surely was (and is) a revered guide and adviser on 
spiritual and intellectual matters of relevance to mass audiences. However, 
the guru role was one he neither sought nor encouraged, and it spurred his 
withdrawal from the living quarters on the Sausalito houseboat, S. S. Vallejo, 
to a less-accessible cottage on Mount Tamalpais. According to Watts (1995): 


I am not trying to create disciples. I work on the principle of a physi- 
cian rather than a clergyman. A physician is always trying to get rid 
of his patients and send them away healthy. . . . My objective is really 
to get rid of you so that you won't need me. (p. 2) 


Still, the common pedagogical problem from the viewpoint of specialists in 
the academy (as well as in the seminary or monastery) is that neophytic readers 
of Watts’ extraordinarily approachable texts often come away imagining they 
know and understand more than is actually the case (see, e.g., Merzel, 2003, 
p. 92). Hence the scathing style of review offered by Nordstrom and Pilgrim 
(1980) intended in part to disabuse students-in-training of any epistemological 
commitments or devotional affectations toward Watts and his work. It may be 
suggested, however, that Watts indeed informed the spiritual and intellectual 
sensibilities of numerous discerning scholars in a variety of academic disciplines. 
Convenient examples are found in humanistic and transpersonal psychologies 
where there are no shortages of eminent thinkers counting Alan Watts as a 
formative influence, including Aanstoos (2005), Haley (1992), Krippner (2012), 
Metzner (2012), Puhakka (2012), Singer (Singer & Roundtree, 2005), Sutich 
(1976), and Welwood (2000). 

Finally, there is the question of Watts’ self-ascription as a “philosophical 
entertainer.” Three observations are offered here. First, the epithet initially 
appeared in Watts’ rhetorical repertoire in the late 1950s near the fulcrum of 
his hermeneutical turn. Indeed, the earliest “entertainer” self-reference by Watts 
to be found in textual form is in a 1959 interview with The Realist magazine 
(see Krassner, 1999, p. 5). Greek folklore suggests that Hermes, often considered 


28 INTRODUCTION 


the etymological root of hermeneutics, was himself a kind of philosophical 
entertainer inhabiting and playing within the flux and flow of language and 
communicative processes. In this way it seems the epithet was Watts’ light- 
hearted tactic for acknowledging his transition toward hermeneutical writing. 
Second, collective judgments about Watts often take the form of what may be 
called a Sartrean triad in the semblance of No Exit: Academic intellectuals reject 
Watts as a popularizer; popular audiences problematically idolize him as a guru; 
and gurus, that is to say, mystics, spiritual teachers, and religious practitioners 
criticize him as too intellectual (e.g., Krishna, 1975; Nordstrom & Pilgrim, 1980; 
see also Humphreys, 1994, p. 30; Pope, 2012, p. 195; Yamada, 2009, p. 221). It 
seems plausible to suggest that Watts’ philosophical entertainer moniker was his 
way of “exiting” the existential dilemma. It was, in other words, an interpre- 
tive strategy intended (successfully or not) to disarm critics and fanatics alike. 

Third and lastly, Watts’ use of the philosophical entertainer epithet as 
rhetorical equipoise coincides with the countercultural revolution of the 1960s, 
and this correlation affords a conclusion drawn previously by Reed Baird (1988) 
that seems no less pertinent in the twenty-first century: 


At a time in a burning and anguished world when theologians spoke 
either of a “wholly other” or totally dead God, when philosophers lost 
themselves in intricate analyses of the meaning of meaning, and when 
far too many psychologists occupied themselves with experiments on 
rats and denied man’s [people’s] freedom, dignity, even his [their] very 
consciousness, Alan Watts sought to restore man’s [people’s] sense of 
being at home in the world... . Watts’ great gift was his ability to 
contribute to the revitalization of America’s intellectual and spiritual 
life, precisely through his remaining always a “divine amateur” who 
was therefore freer than most intellectuals to perceive and express 
healing versions of Reality not generally available to modern con- 
sciousness. (p. 74)

PART ONE 


Language and Mysticism 


CHAPTER ONE 


On the Meaning and Relation of 
Absolute and Relative (1950) 


DO YOU EVER WONDER? 


H” interesting would it be to be able to read the thoughts of 
others? There they are, walking down the street or sitting idly 
in a train or bus, and their eyes tell little or nothing of what is going on inside 
their heads. What do they think about? What schemes, what puzzles, what 
dreams, what mysteries, are they turning over in their minds? It might not be 
interesting at all, for it is possible that, whether working or idling, so many 
of these people are not interested, and who is not interested is not interesting. 
Their minds may just be turning over the most humdrum little worries, or 
odds and ends of gossip, or merely futile fantasies. In this case, the power to 
read thoughts would be a dubious gift—the mastery of a language with an 
exceedingly dreary literature. 

But surely there must be times when the thoughts of the dullest person 
are wonderful. Of course, we use the word “wonderful” in two senses: “I have 
just had a wonderful time,” or “This is a most wonderful universe.” In the first 
sense, “wonderful” is just an exaggeration for pleasant or amusing. In the second, 
it means what it says—full of wonder, of fascination, mystery, and interest. Yet 
the two senses are not always separate, because a life that has been spent in 
wondering will almost certainly have been a wonderful life. Most children seem 
to be having an interesting time, for the world is a new thing in their eyes, 
and they are always asking questions. The more one asks, and gets answers 
to, questions, the more are the questions to be asked, for the more we know,

46 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


the more we know we don’t know. The size of the mystery always grows in 
proportion to the increase of knowledge. Discovery is always, to some extent, 
the finding of new things about which you are ignorant. 

A person who has given up asking questions, who has ceased to wonder, 
has stopped living because he has stopped growing. For life is like a stream in 
the sense that it must flow on or cease to be a stream. And where the mind 
of man ceases to flow out in wonder and interest towards the ocean of reality 
that surrounds him, it turns back upon itself and becomes a stagnant pool. A 
person who is miserable or bored is one whose mind has turned back upon 
itself, a person who gets in the way of his own experience, who frets over 
how he feels and how he would like to feel, and yet always seems to feel the 
same—frustrated. Yet all this turning back, this self-concern, is like a snake 
trying to make a good meal off his own tail—a futile procedure that makes 
him gag, and that boils down to the ultimate absurdity of trying to feed on 
one’s own hunger. 

Obviously, then, life is interesting and wonderful to the extent that one 
has interest in it and wonder for it. It is superficially wonderful if you wonder 
only at superficial things, and deeply wonderful if you wonder at deep things. 
To wonder what Mrs. Smith will wear for the party, what would have hap- 
pened if you had been the son of a millionaire, what the dentist will have to 
say about your teeth, or whether it will be a fine weekend, is to wonder only 
at surfaces. It seems astonishing that there can be minds that never go deeper, 
that never want to know who or what is the mysterious power of consciousness 
that looks out through Mrs. Smith’s eyes, how it is that I am myself and not 
someone else, why it is that I love pleasure and hate pain, or how there comes 
to be a sun that can shine. 

It is difficult to imagine many questions more interesting than these. Yet the 
asking and answering of them is a process called philosophy, which is popularly 
thought to be one of the drier subjects in a college curriculum as well as one 
of the most unprofitable professions. If such things are dry and dull, life is then 
dry and dull at its very core, and one must just as well commit suicide without 
further ado. This is, perhaps, what our world is doing. Its daily life must be 
such a round of inane tedium that it can think of nothing better to do with 
the marvels of atomic fission than make a sensational bang, and blow itself up. 

Needless to say, philosophy is not just another course in college, or the wear- 
ing out of one’s mind with volumes of incomprehensible verbiage. Philosophy, 
as Aristotle said, begins and ends in wonder—wonder at what lies beneath the 
surface, not only of the sun, moon, and stars, but also of the most trivial and 
commonplace events. Every child is born a philosopher. Not only does he take 
things apart to find out how they work, but also he asks the most profound 
questions as to who made God, whether space goes on forever, what happened 
before anything happened, whether he would have been born if Mother had 
married someone else, why this, why that, why anything and everything. It is 
tragic that this spontaneous venture of wonder and interest in the roots of 


ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE 47 


life bogs down either in parental annoyance, or in university courses where 
gentlemen expert in chopping logic dismiss all such questions as meaningless. 

In a very strict sense it may be meaningless to ask why there is a universe, or 
whether I might have been someone else than me. But if the human mind had 
never wondered at these things, there would have been no physics, no chemistry, 
no biology or astronomy. Perhaps a question that has no answer is a meaning- 
less question, but we can never find this out until we are sure it has no answer. 
And the good scientist is never quite sure, being the least dogmatic of people. 

For many hundreds of years the scientific mind has been trying to find 
out what things are—what stones and stars and men are made of. Reducing 
them to simpler elements, it wants to know, in turn, what these are made of. 
Finding that men and mountains and air are arrangements of such simpler 
things as carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen, and that these are composed of 
molecules, and these of atoms, and these of electrons, protons, and neutrons, 
we begin to wonder how much further we can go, how much longer we can 
ask, “What is it made of?” For we have brought everything down to such a 
fine point, that the investigation is now rather like trying to stick the point of a 
needle into the point of a needle. If the mind of man is of the same substance 
as the universe that it investigates, must there not come a time when the whole 
inquiry is just a single substance trying to define itself—like a mouth trying to 
kiss itself or a flame to burn itself? 

At present there does seem to be a tendency among scientists to feel that 
this “main line” of inquiry has reached its limits, as if the mind had reached 
an impenetrable wall, and must henceforth be content to explore its surface. In 
a remarkable passage in The Evolution of Physics Einstein and Infeld (1938) say: 


In our endeavor to understand reality we are somewhat like a man 
trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the 
face and the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way 
of opening the case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of 
a mechanism which could be responsible for all the things he observes, 
but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could 
explain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture 
with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility 
or the meaning of such a comparison. (p. 38) 


Back at the end of the nineteenth century, Maxwell foresaw the same 
problem, and explained it with an illustration employing a cabinet instead of 
a watch. Imagine a cabinet whose doors are forever sealed, but in each door 
there is a minute hole from which there extends a string. When we pull string 
A, string B goes up, and conversely. The scientist can but note the regularity 
of this event. As to what goes on inside the cabinet—whether A and B are two 
ends of one string, or whether there is some more complex mechanism—he 
can only speculate; he can never know for certain. 


48 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


If physics cannot penetrate the watch or the cabinet, or if its method of 
inquiry has reduced itself to a needle trying to prick the point of a needle, 
must the whole problem be brought to a close? Must it be said that any further 
questioning as to what reality is, is meaningless? One may say so, and yet the 
human mind will go on wondering, because unsatisfied with the answer. The 
problem is simply whether it is entirely useless and absurd to do so. 

The very analogy employed by Einstein and Infeld (1938) suggests an answer. 
Strictly speaking, the function of science may be simply to observe, measure, 
and predict the movements of the watch’s hands and the rhythm of its ticking. 
Beyond this point, no observation is possible, and no measurement. But in fact, 
the scientist does form theories of what lies inside the watch, and tests them 
by the degree to which they enable him to predict what the watch will do. In 
this respect science enters the realm of philosophy and metaphysics, which is 
the act of wondering about the inside of the watch or the cabinet, about the 
depths of reality that are beyond the experience of the senses. 

The philosopher forms and tests his theories in somewhat the same way 
as the scientist. He develops an idea of what may be inside the watch and 
responsible for its external movements from things that he has seen outside the 
watch. Outside, he has observed the things that make movements and noises 
similar to those of the watch, as well as the processes that cause them. He 
then reasons that the movements and noises of the watch must have similar 
causes, assuming that the relation of cause and effect that exists outside must 
also exist inside. 

To these theories he applies a test not unlike the scientist’s test of predic- 
tion. He asks whether his theories enable man to make a better adaptation to 
the world. If they do so, he assumes that his theory is in harmony with, or 
corresponds to, the unknown reality that causes this world. But this is not all. 
The problem of adaptation to the future course of events is not the philosopher’s 
only or even chief concern. For he realizes that it is of no use to be able to 
predict and adjust oneself to the future unless you are also capable of having 
harmony with life in the present. Lacking this, you are always preparing for a 
tomorrow that never comes. You predict, but do not fully enjoy the fruits of 
prediction and planning when they become present. 

Therefore the philosopher also loves philosophy for itself. He finds that 
wondering is perhaps the highest form of enjoyment, because in this act he 
loses himself in the contemplation of the most fascinating of all things—the 
reality that lies beyond the senses. All enjoyment, all real happiness involves 
this loss of self-consciousness through absorption in something wonderful. Can 
there, then, be any other higher happiness than absorption in the “highest” 
mystery—the unseen reality that underlies this whole universe? In the words 
of Goethe, “The highest to which man can attain is wonder; and if the prime 
phenomenon makes him wonder, let him be content; nothing higher can it 
give him, and nothing further should he seek for behind it; here is the limit.” 


ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE 49 


OUR INCOMPLETE MAP OF LIFE 


We come, then, to the barrier that the scientists say they cannot pass unless 
they join hands with the philosophers and begin to speculate and wonder. This 
wondering is no useless reaching into the void, and no mere attempt to satisfy 
curiosity. The correct solution to many of the problems of living in this everyday 
world depend upon accurate reasoning about the world beyond the senses. For 
this other world is in no way remote from the world of practical life; it is really 
the same world, understood more deeply. It is as if we were traveling across a 
sheet of ice. The senses can see, as it were, only the surface, and other means 
must be used to discover where the ice is thick enough to carry our weight, 
and so to decide what course the journey must take. 

We must be prepared, however, for reasoning about the unseen to lead us 
to some strange conclusions. Already the scientists have found that their own 
theories of “the world below the surface” are very hard to describe in concrete 
images. They speak of space being curved, and how can we imagine space with 
a curve in it, as if it were the film of a soap-bubble without, however, either an 
inside or an outside? While we shall always use concrete images for purposes 
of illustration, it must nevertheless be remembered that these are only images, 
and that what we are talking about is not exactly like them. A familiar example 
of this difficulty may be seen in trying to draw a cube on a flat surface. 

To represent a cube on this flat sheet of paper, we draw two squares, and 
then join their corners with straight lines (see figure 1.1). But this figure is not 
a cube. For all the angles of a cube are right angles, but in this drawing many 
of them are not. Yet because we know what a real cube is, we can imagine one 
from this drawing by using the convention of perspective. Because we are famil- 
iar with a world of three dimensions, we can easily understand representations 
of this solid world upon a flat surface where there are only two dimensions. 

Supposing, however, there were people living in a world of two dimensions, 
people who had never seen, and had no idea of a third. They would find it most 
difficult to understand this drawing. A line perpendicular to their world would 
seem to them like a point, a surface like a line, and a solid like a surface. They

50 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


would see the drawing here only as two squares with triangles adjoining them. 
Thus we are somewhat like these inhabitants of “Flatland” in our attempts to 
understand the world beyond our senses. Indeed, it took many centuries for 
our own ancestors to understand how this earth could be spherical, because to 
their limited point of view it seemed so flat. How could anyone walk on the 
underside of such a globe without falling off? 

It is easy enough to see how the inhabitants of “Flatland” could not under- 
stand our drawing of a cube. It is fairly easy to put ourselves in their position 
by doing something else to our drawing. Here is the square. Think of it as 
made by moving the upright line at the left (one dimension) over to the right 
(two dimensions) (see figure 1.2). Here we have the two dimensions of length 
and breadth. Now by moving the whole square through the third dimension of 
depth, we have once more the cube (see figure 1.3). So far the figure is quite 
understandable. But now let us suppose that there is still another dimension, at 
right angles to each one of the three. We move the whole cube through this 
dimension, and get what is called a tesseract (see figure 1.4). 

Now you can feel like the people in “Flatland,” for you are looking at a 
drawing of a four-dimensional cube, which is something you cannot possibly 
imagine. Thus thinking about a four-dimensional world in terms of three is 
not unlike thinking about the unseen world in terms of the seen. We can 
represent it, but not exactly.

We know, then, that one of the chief characteristics of our ordinary, every- 
day world is that it has three dimensions. What are some of its other important 
characteristics? Perhaps the most obvious is that everything is, without exception, 
in a state of movement and change. Every planet moves around its sun. Every 
sun and star moves around other suns and stars. Every solid object is in fact 
a cluster of pulsating electrons. Not only is every form in motion, but at the 
same time every form is inconstant, changing in shape and substance rapidly 
(as the smoke) or extremely slowly (as the rocks). In the words of the Greek 
philosopher Heraclitus, “Everything flows,” and even 


The hills are shadows, 
And they flow from form to form, 
And nothing stands. 


Hardly less obvious is the fact that all known things exist only in relation to 
each other. In the first place, they depend on each other. Every thing is an effect, 
and thus depends upon some cause. There can be no life apart from water, air, 
and sunlight; no air and water without an earth; no earth without a sun; no 
sun without a galaxy of stars; no stars without space, time, and energy—and 
so on to we know not what extent. In the second place, our knowledge of 
this world depends entirely upon the relation of contrasts or opposites. Light 
is unimaginable without darkness. Long is meaningless save by contrast with 
short. Substance is unthinkable without space, motion without relative stillness, 
heat without cold, fast without slow, hard without soft, sound without silence, 
pleasure without pain, and life without death. Indeed, it is absolutely impossible 
to express a meaning without making a contrast, or to think of a thing that is 
in no way distinguished from something else. 

The known world is then a world of change and relativity. Everything 
changes, and everything is relative to some other thing. We have never come 
across anything entirely permanent and absolute. Must we therefore conclude 
that there is nothing unchanging, eternal, and absolute? 


52 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


This is, indeed, the picture of the universe that is presented by many of 
the most influential thinkers of our time—a world of pure relativity in which 
there is no single stable element. It is something like an infinitely tall skyscraper 
where floor stands upon floor, but no floor stands on solid ground. From the 
height at which we now stand, we can look down (into the past), and see the 
building disappearing to a “vanishing point” in an immense well of space. But 
if there is no solid ground on which the whole structure can stand, the floors 
must descend for ever beyond this vanishing point, standing on each other and 
on nothing else. Or, to change the illustration, such a universe is not unlike a 
nation where each individual makes his living, not out of the soil, but by taking 
in his neighbor’s washing. Such a nation would be as economically unstable as 
the skyscraper would be architecturally unstable. The entire structure would 
be a process of collapse. 

But we need never entertain such fantastic pictures if we look carefully 
at the idea on which they are based—the notion that “Everything is relative; 
everything is in a state of change.” For in fact these statements do not mean 
anything at all. They are pure nonsense. 

We saw that such ideas as change, motion, and energy had meaning only 
because of their opposites. “Change” is a meaningful word, an understandable 
process, only in relation to stillness or permanence. We recognize change by 
comparing it with something unchanging. If, then, everything changes, how do 
we know that it changes, since there is nothing permanent in relation to which 
it changes? We might just as well say, “Everything is half,” or “Everything is 
up,” or, for that matter, “Everything is blah.” 

But if such things as change and permanence exist only in relation to each 
other, can we not say that “Everything is relative’? Certainly the same rule 
must apply. The word “relative” is meaningless when applied to everything. 
Indeed, there is something fundamentally peculiar about these “Everything is” 
statements. None of them make sense. And the peculiar thing is this: to say 
something about everything is to say nothing about everything! It is like paint- 
ing a picture that is all one color: you have no picture. 

We can go further. If it makes no sense to say “Everything is relative,” it 
does not even make sense to say “Everything is.” To say that everything has 
existence adds absolutely nothing to one’s knowledge of the universe, for one is 
not actually saying anything about everything. It is merely to say, “Every thing 
which exists, exists.” In other words, “A rose is a rose.” So what? 

We can begin to see, now, what is the real difficulty with these statements. In 
making them we have used many words that actually mean something— “thing,” 
“relative,” “is,” “change, 
men) exist,” and make sense because I am implying that “Some things (such as 


29 «6 


exists.” I can say, “Some things (such as planets and 


gryphons and goblins) do not exist.” Obviously, then, the difficulty is simply in 
the word “everything.” It cannot mean anything unless it has an opposite. But 
if it does not have an opposite, it will be impossible for us to form any ideas 
at all about the world, the universe that we experience as a whole. 


ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE 53 


So we must ask the question, “Is there anything else besides everything?” 
It may sound like a silly question, but if the answer is “No,” we shall have to 
take the word “everything” out of the dictionary as a mere meaningless noise. 
Who, then, are the candidates for the position of the opposite of everything? 

The first to be examined is obviously “Nothing.” This is a strange candidate 
who has to be disqualified at once, having the odd defect of not even appear- 
ing for the examination. He is not. Furthermore the word “nothing” cannot 
be used in any sensible statement as the opposite of everything. I can say, 
“There is nothing in this box,” and make sense. But if nothing is the opposite 
of everything, I should also be able to say, “There is everything in this box,” 
and still make sense. But I can't. 

In other words, to oppose everything to nothing is simply not to oppose it 
to anything. If no other opposite can be found, the idea of everything, of the 
universe itself, is in a most precarious position. And if the idea is precarious, 
what about the reality? For surely the two are inseparable. Surely the word 
“everything” has meaning in that it denotes a reality—the reality of all stars, all 
galaxies, all bodies in space and time, all processes, all relations, all electrons. 
Yet apparently these things, all things, are like some princess in a story-book 
who must find a husband or be beheaded. Nothing, in other words, no hus- 
band, simply won't do. 

What, then, could be the opposite that will make the idea and the reality 
of everything both meaningful and possible? For if this opposite is to be some 
thing, as distinct from nothing, will not this something already be included in 
“everything” and so still be unable to be its opposite? 

Indeed, it seems as if the strangeness of reality will have to surpass every 
flight of fancy that myth, legend, or fairy-tale has ever conceived. For the prince 
who can save the princess from having her head chopped off must be neither 
a nothing nor a something, for a nothing is no husband, and a something is 
the princess herself. 

It depends, of course, on what we mean by a thing. For to talk about all 
things is actually to talk about all stars, electrons, etc., that is, about all relative 
things. If the Flatlanders were to talk about all things, they would be meaning 
all things in their world of two dimensions. But we know of other things, such 
as cubes, which would be outside their definition of all things. 

Let us suppose that the relative world that we know is like a map, but 
an incomplete map in the sense that it has edges or margins at which roads, 
rivers, and oceans simply come to an abrupt end. These edges are the limits 
of our sense-knowledge. Now science gives us theories of what lies beyond 
these edges, but these theories have a particular limitation. The scientist looks 
at the map, and sees that on the map itself every road leads to a town and 
every river to an ocean—except those that run off the edge. He cannot see 
how these end. But he reasons that roads and rivers running off the map will 
do the same things as those on the map: they will lead to other towns and 
other oceans. His theories as to the positions of these other towns and oceans 


54 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


may be most ingenious. He may deduce that two roads that, at the point of 
leaving the map, have been approaching each other will probably lead to the 
same town. But this particular kind of reasoning leads only to the idea of more 
towns, more roads, more rivers, and more oceans. 

Yet the philosopher wants to know whether this map is simply one sec- 
tion of a surface that goes on for ever and ever. Is there anything else, he asks, 
besides indefinite map, indefinite towns, roads, and rivers? Is there anything else 
besides everything?—“everything” being defined as a surface bearing towns, 
roads, and rivers. 

Now the philosopher knows, from evidence within his experience, that 
you cannot have unsupported surfaces. He has never seen any object that was 
simply a surface, much less a surface indefinitely extended. He knows that every 
surface is finite, and is the outside of a solid. If you travel across a surface, 
you will go round the solid and return to the same place. He reasons that the 
same will be true of the map. Follow any road far enough off the map, and 
you will return to the same place on the map—sometime—whether the shape 
of the underlying solid be spherical, cubic, ovoid, or pyramidal. 

The same process of reasoning suggests, therefore, that the known universe 
is part of a finite system. It is not galaxies of stars and areas of space extend- 
ing for ever and ever, still less a series of effects and causes going backwards 
for ever and ever in a straight line of time—a skyscraper standing on nothing. 
Underlying the finite surface is a solid; underlying two dimensions is a third; 
underlying the map is the terrestrial globe. But just as the Flatlanders cannot 
conceive a third dimension, a cube or sphere, so we have difficulty in conceiving 
the kind of “Something” that would underlie the “everything” that we know 
with our finite senses. 

Nevertheless, it is reasonable and necessary to suppose that this “Something” 
exists as the solid, the opposite, supporting and giving meaning to all that we 
know. It is not in the class of relative things, just as the sphere is not in the class 
of surfaces, and the earth not in the class of towns, roads, rivers, and oceans. 

It is furthermore reasonable to conclude that if all known things are rela- 
tive and changing, spatial and temporal, the “Something” that supports them 
and gives them both meaning and existence by contrast, will be absolute and 
permanent, spaceless and timeless. For want of a better name, we shall call it 
the Absolute. 


BEYOND TIME AND SPACE 


When you take a voyage into unknown latitudes, you must remember that you 
cannot remain on course without making corrections for wind and currents. 
Similar “corrections” must be made, and held constantly in mind, in trying to 
go beyond time and space into the realm of the Absolute. Remember that you 
cannot represent a cube on a flat surface without using the convention, the 


ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE 55 


trick, of perspective. You represent the third dimension with lines that are still 
in two dimensions. Similarly, when you want to show, on a flat map, that the 
earth is spherical you draw curved lines of longitude, or draw each “side” of 
the globe within a circular border. This results in distortions and inaccuracies, 
which will be confusing if it is forgotten that “tricks” have been used. 

Representing the globe on a flat map is like trying to talk and think about 
the Absolute. The two dimensions of the map correspond respectively to time 
and space, and the human mind cannot think except in terms of time and space. 
Alternatively, we can think of the two dimensions of the map as corresponding 
to the fact that we have to think in terms of opposites. Because the mind is 
part of the relative world, it cannot possibly escape this limitation. 

Therefore we can only talk about the Absolute by using a convention. To 
avoid confusion, we must be clear from the start as to what this convention 
is, and constantly make “corrections” for it. In brief, the convention is that we 
must talk about the Absolute as if it were another relative thing. Otherwise 
we should not be able to talk it at all, for we have no language, no ideas, at 
our disposal other than the relative. 

This will be clarified if we rehearse, in another way, the argument that 
compels us to admit that there is an Absolute. Experience shows us nothing 
whatsoever that is not dependent on something else. No part of this universe 
can exist without dependence on, and relation to, other parts. This is relativ- 
ity. But it is simple to understand that if everything is dependent, the universe 
cannot exist. For if absolutely everything is dependent, there is nothing on 
which it depends. 

It does not help in the least to try to get out of this dilemma by making 
the dependent universe infinite, for you do not get an independent thing by 
adding many dependent things together. A hat hangs on a peg attached to a 
hat that hangs on a peg attached to a hat... . However large this hat-chain 
may be, it collapses unless it finally arrives at some fixed and independent peg. 
Hanging all by itself, it is absurd, like the grin of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in 
Wonderland, which hung in the air when the cat had vanished. To make the 
chain infinite is only to make it infinitely absurd. This is not a solution of the 
problem. It is merely the indefinite postponement of a solution. Nor does it 
help to hang the last hat on a peg attached to the first, making the process of 
dependence circular. It still collapses. 

But we know that there are things, and that all known things are dependent. 
We are thus forced to the conclusion that there must be some unknown thing 
that is independent—that does not hang on anything because it does not need 
to. If there is not, then there cannot be any dependent things. But there are! 

In our known world there are only relatively independent things. That is 
to say, there are only things that are independent of some things. For instance, 
hat No. 4 on the chain will be independent of 3, 2, and 1, but dependent on 
5 and all those above. For us, then, the terms dependent and independent 


56 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


are relative. They have meaning only by contrast with each other. We cannot 
really think or conceive a thing independent of all other things, because every 
known thing is dependent. 

To put it in another way: we describe and know things by their relations 
with each other. We know light by contrast with darkness. Light without dark- 
ness, or darkness without light, are alike inconceivable. Similarly, a relative, or 
dependent, world is meaningless save by contrast with an absolute or indepen- 
dent. But it should follow, logically, that an absolute is inconceivable without 
the relative. If so, we shall only be saying that the independent must depend 
on the dependent, or that the absolute can exist only in relation to the rela- 
tive. But this will amount to saying that it is neither absolute nor independent! 

This is the inescapable limitation of our two-dimensional way of think- 
ing. We are compelled to think of the Absolute as the opposite of the relative, 
because we can only think in opposites—in relativities. This is the convention 
that we must use if we are to think of the Absolute at all; we have to represent 
it as something relative, as, on the surface, the solid must be represented by 
something flat. Therefore we have to remember this correction: the Absolute 
is the opposite of the relative, without which the relative could have neither 
meaning nor existence. But it is not opposed to the relative in the same way 
that relative things, such as light and darkness, are opposed to each other. The 
difference is this: whereas the relative cannot exist without the Absolute, the 
Absolute can exist without the relative. If it could not, it would not be the 
Absolute because it would depend on the relative. 

This proposition is only illogical in the same sense that the angles of a 
cube drawn on a flat surface are not all right angles. Logic is simply the law 
of relativity. It corresponds to the fact that on a flat surface—in the world of 
relativity—you can only have length and breadth. You may draw a third line 
to represent depth, but in fact it will still lie in the dimensions of length and 
breadth, and your statement that it forms right angles with the other two lines 
will seem absurd—i.e., illogical. But it is only illogical if there are no other 
dimensions than length and breadth. 

Similarly, it is only illogical to speak of the Absolute if “everything is 
relative.” But logic itself is enough to show that the statement, “Everything is 
relative,” is meaningless. Thought, in other words, requires something beyond 
itself that it cannot define, just as the existence of a surface requires an under- 
lying solid that cannot, however, be actually represented in terms of surface. 

Now we can never arrive at the Absolute by indefinite extension of the 
relative, just as we shall never get the idea of the solid from the indefinite 
increase of the surface—unless, perhaps, the surface bends back on itself and 
we return to our starting-point. This was the weakness of the old arguments 
for the Absolute that tried to prove that events must run back to a First Cause 
in time. Beyond every time you can always imagine an earlier time, beyond 
every hat you can always conceive another hat. Logically, you need never arrive 


ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE 57 


at the first time, or the fixed hat-peg. But because you need never do so, logic 
itself is indicating that the direction of your search is futile. 

We ask, “On what does this dependent universe depend?” We look back and 
back into time, or out and out into space, to find only more and more dependent 
things. In this direction we never arrive at anything final. The only gain from 
this quest is an increasing sense of the absurdity of a purely relative cosmos. 

Our thinking must, therefore, take a new departure—a jump into a new 
dimension, not following time and space for ever, but, as it were, turning off at 
right angles to them. This will give us a very different picture of the First Cause 
than the old picture of the Original Push that, aeons ago, started the universe 
off. The universal process is not, so to speak, a row of bricks falling down 
because God pushed the first brick (see figure 1.5). We shall find the First Cause 
not so much at the temporal beginning of everything as at the present root of 
everything. Picture time as a sphere, like the astronomers’ curved space. The 
Origin of this sphere, the First Cause, the Absolute, will not be anywhere on 
the sphere, but “inside” it (see figure 1.6). This shows us all the events in time, 
and for that matter in space too, radiating from the First Cause. Only we must 
be careful to remember that this is a “conventional” picture, and that there is 
not actually any space or time between the center and any point on the outside. 

Around the outside of this sphere all events depend on one another in 
a complex network that has no observable beginning or end. But while each 


j

Figure 1.6. Events in time radiating from the First Cause. 


58 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


depends on the others, all depend on the center—that does not depend on 
anything at all. 

Something analogous to this idea of the Absolute as the “center” of all 
things is found in modern physics. For in asking, “What makes the universe 
tick?” physics has found that the most profitable line of inquiry has not been 
the investigation of an unobservable past, nor even the plumbing of fathom- 
less space. The most fruitful results have come from looking into the heart of 
things, asking not “What made them as they are?” but “What makes them as 
they are?” In such a way we seek the First Cause neither in an immeasurably 
distant past, nor in a heaven beyond the uttermost nebulae. We seek it within 
the electrons that constitute our being at this moment. 

The clue, then, to an understanding of the Absolute is that the relative 
world requires an opposite in order to exist, since by itself relativity is meaning- 
less. But this opposite is not within the scheme of relativity, for which reason, 
it does not require the relative. Between relative things, opposition is mutual 
and reciprocal. But in the Major Dyad of Absolute and Relative, the opposition 
is “one way only.” 

Keeping this peculiar relationship in mind, we can understand certain 
properties of the Absolute simply by contrasting it with properties of the rela- 
tive. Other properties of the Absolute can be suggested by asking what kind 
of reality would be sufficient to cause all various qualities and relations of the 
known universe. 

We saw that among the chief characteristics of the relative world were 
time, space, and change. By contrast, these imply that the Absolute is eternal, 
infinite, and immutable. But in using these words, we must be careful not 
to confuse them with certain popular and incorrect senses that custom has 
attached to them. 

To the average man eternal means everlasting, eternal life being a life that 
goes on through endless time without ceasing. But this somewhat nightmar- 
ish idea has nothing to do with eternity in its true sense. For eternity is not 
time—much less unending time. Time is perhaps not easy to define. When 
asked what time was, St. Augustine replied, “I know, but when you ask me I 
don’t!” Yet if we consider what we mean by time, it is easy to see that it means 
at least this—the experience, or occurrence, of events in a one-way stream of 
succession. Time is really change—a process in which events come one after 
another in an irreversible order. In our basic diagram of the Absolute and the 
Relative, time is motion round the outer circle, so that B is after A and before 
C. A, B, and C stand in successive order (see figure 1.7). 

But from the standpoint of the center, from which the whole surface “radi- 
ates,” A, B, and C are all equally present, for we saw that there is neither time 
nor space between the center and any point on the circumference. Eternity is, 
then, a standpoint from which all events are not successive but simultaneous. 


ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE 59 


Figure 1.7. Relations of time and eternity. 


When you look at your hand, you can see all five fingers at once, even though 
they are distant from each other in space. Supposing, however, that the five 
fingers are five distant points of time—the years 1900, 1905, 1910, 1915, and 
1920. Eternity is a point of reference to which these five points of time are as 
present as your fingers are present to you. 

Or again: if you walk into a dark room with a flashlight that casts a thin 
beam, you will only be able to know what is in the room by shining the bean 
upon one small section after another, successively. This is like the viewpoint of 
time. But if you turn on the main light in the ceiling, you will see the whole 
room at once, having a view somewhat like that of eternity. Eternity is therefore 
a sort of permanent moment, in which all times are now. 

Somewhat the same principles underlie the true meaning of infinity. To 
say that the Absolute is infinite is not to say that it is indefinitely immense, 
like a space going outward for ever and ever. As eternity is a point of reference 
to which all times are now, infinity is a point of reference to which all places 
are here. This is why it is possible to say that the Absolute is everywhere, or 
omnipresent, not like a gas that is diffused, but as something that is present at 
every point of space in its entirety. Infinity in the “immense” meaning, would 
not be true infinity at all: it would be ordinary, relative space. 

Likewise, to say that the Absolute is immutable is not to say that it is 
static—i.e., that it remains without change or movement for an interminable 
period of time. This is merely relative stillness—the stillness of a rock as com- 
pared with the stillness of a river. A static stillness of this kind could hardly 
be responsible for all the motions of this universe. The Absolute is immutable 
because it does not change, and it does not change because its whole action and 
existence is simultaneous—not successive. The “action” by which it causes the 
relative world requires no effort, that is, no crossing of space or perpetuation 


60 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


through time. The action by which it caused the lighting of the first suns is 
the same identical action by which it now causes the vibration of a mosquito’s 
wing. There has been no change, for it does all things at once. 

Although, to this point, we have said several things about the Absolute, 
we have not actually said what it is. We have said that it is, because a purely 
relative world requires it as its necessary opposite. We have said what it is not, 
because, by opposition to the relative world, we find it to be nontemporal, 
nonspatial, and nonchangeable. But we are never going to be able to say what it 
is, because human thought and language can only answer the question “What?’ 
by standing outside the object to be described, and comparing it with other 
things. But we cannot stand outside the Absolute without immediately ceasing 
to exist. Every point from which one might look at it is a point “inside” it, and 
the very ability to look is a power that the Absolute supplies. Now if our eyes 
cannot look at themselves, if the knower cannot know himself, how much less 
can we see and know the Origin of sight and knowledge. 

In the act of knowing, the knower knows that he is. He also knows that 
he is not the things that he knows, as the eyes are not the things that they see. 
Our knowledge of the Absolute is, then, similar to this obscure knowledge of 
ourselves, since we know that we are and what we are not, rather than what 
we are. We cannot stand outside ourselves to see what we are. This kind of 
knowledge of the Absolute may make it seem something peculiarly vague and 
negative. 

But still another kind of knowledge is possible, knowledge based on the 
fact that, because everything in the relative world depends on the Absolute and 
is caused by it, the nature of the Absolute must be adequate to produce this 
world. Let us suppose for a moment that the Absolute is some kind of blind 
force, like electricity—a force essentially blind and unconscious and mechani- 
cal. Would a force of this kind be able to produce the everyday world that we 
know? To many people, this seems possible enough, for if a blind force were to 
go on shaping and re-shaping itself long enough, the chances are that it would 
eventually shape itself into this form—this form that we call life, knowledge, 
beauty, order, and so forth. 

The idea may seem plausible, but it has a fatal flaw. If I assert that the 
Absolute, the basic force of the universe, is unconscious and unintelligent, I 
must also assert that I myself, and my conscious mind, are parts and products 
of this force. The idea that this is so will also have to be part of it, because it is 
part of my mind. But if myself, my mind, and my idea, are nothing but special 
forms of unintelligent force, how can I assert that this idea is intelligent? For I 
am really saying this: “My idea that the basic force of the universe is unintel- 
ligent is itself a form of this unintelligence!” If so, it is not an intelligent idea. 

If I am to claim that my own mind is in any sense conscious or intel- 
ligent, I am bound to admit that the force that shapes it is at least conscious 
and intelligent. To say that consciousness is a special form of unconsciousness, 


ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE 61 


and intelligence a special form of unintelligence, is to say that the presence of 
a certain power is a special form of its absence. This comes perilously close to 
saying that something is a special form of nothing. 

Nonsense of this kind is the inevitable result of denying to the First Cause 
at least the properties and faculties that we ourselves enjoy. This is not to say, 
however, that the Absolute is conscious and intelligent in the same way that 
we are. It is saying that if it can cause intelligence, it must not only be at least 
intelligent, but, indeed, something more than intelligent. 

The reason for this “more” is that the less is always the result of the greater, 
never the greater of the less. Take, for example, the power of heat. Something 
that is merely warm does not, all by itself, become hot. More heat is not simply 
the result of less heat. The increase of heat must be derived from something 
most hot—such as fire. Similarly, more life (or more intelligence) does not just 
“evolve” all by itself from less life, or no life—for this would imply again the 
nonsense that the presence of a power is the result of its absence. What we 
call evolution is the progressive derivation of life from something that is most 
alive—as water gets hotter and hotter, and finally turns into steam, by deriving 
heat progressively from the fire beneath it. 

We can see, then, that the evolution of consciousness and mind from the 
relatively blind world of vegetable and mineral nature is progressive sharing 
in the life and power of the Absolute. This implies that the more we are able 
to share in the life of the Absolute, the more conscious, the more intelligent, 
we can become. For this reason, knowledge of the Absolute is no mere philo- 
sophical pastime, but a matter of the highest possible importance. It can carry 
us yet further in the course of evolution, and lead to possibilities of life and 
knowledge beyond our dreams. 

This, indeed, is what is implied in the truth that the Absolute is not only 
our “origin,” but also our “goal.” In the traditional language of philosophy, 
the Absolute is known both as the First Cause and as the Final Cause—that is, 
the end toward which the universal process moves, as well as the point from 
which it begins. 

To understand this point, we must remember again that as the world-process 
does not start from the Absolute in time, neither does it disappear into it in 
time. Our diagram of the Absolute-Relative relationship is seen in figure 1.8:

Not this (figure 1.9):

Figure 1.9. An incorrect view of the absolute-relative relationship. 


This is only to say that the relative world never was, and never will become, 
the same thing as the Absolute. By its nature, the Absolute is not relative, and 
could not become relative without ceasing to be Absolute. The same is true in 
reverse. The relative is not the Absolute, and could not become the Absolute 
without ceasing to exist. 

The process of becoming lies only around the circle. There is no becoming 
as between the circle and its center, for becoming requires time, and between 
circle and center there is no time. When water boils over the fire, it does 
not become fire, even though fire is the cause of its boiling. It becomes hot 
water, and eventually steam. In other words, it becomes as like fire as water 
can become. In the same way, the relative world “surrounding” the unchang- 
ing fire of the Absolute will, in time, become as like the Absolute as relative 
things can become. 

To know, then, what the Absolute is like in terms of relative things and 
relative knowledge, to represent the Absolute in the form of the relative, is to 
move toward the goal and perfection of relative existence. Thus the task of 
philosophy is to show man where he is going—the end toward which all his 
activities must be directed if they are not to be in vain.

CHAPTER TWO 


The Negative Way (1951) 


T? the Western mind, one of the most disconcerting things about 
Oriental teachings as found in the Vedanta and Buddhism is their 
negative language. We receive the impression that they think of God, the ulti- 
mate reality, as a void, and of man’s final destiny as an absorption in this void 
with the consequent loss of his unique personality. In the Vedanta, Brahman is 
almost always described by negations—the nondual, the nonfinite, the formless, 
the nonparticular. At the same time, the finite world of forms and individual 
beings is described as the unreal, the maya, which must disappear from the 
awakened consciousness. 

In Buddhism, the highest reality is called sunyata, the empty, which is neither 
being nor nonbeing, which is so ineffable that every statement about it must 
be false. It appears that the way to a realization of the ultimate involves the 
strict denial of one’s own and every other form of existence. Most Western 
people think that “variety is the spice of life,” and therefore do not take at all 
kindly to a view of the highest good that seems to require the obliteration of 
all finite experiences. A state of “consciousness,” which is neither “conscious 
nor unconscious,” in which all particular things seem to vanish into a luminous 
haze, does not appeal to them as anything but extremely boring. Furthermore, 
they cannot see that such ideas of the highest reality have any philosophical 
cogency. For how can the basis, the ground, of these very solid, concrete, and 
particular finite experiences be so much of a nothing? How can something 
so startling, so real-seeming, so simultaneously wonderful and tragic as the 
everyday world, emerge from so impalpable a void?

64 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


The problem here is almost entirely one of language, for it has never 
been clear to the Western mind in what sense these negations are intended. 
By contrast, the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic religions appear to be very 
positive, for their statements about the highest reality are affirmations rather 
than denials. Instead of speaking coldly about the “nondual infinite” they speak 
warmly of the Righteous Father, who is a living, personal Being, whose nature 
is unbounded justice and love. So long as it is imagined that, say, the Vedanta 
and Christianity are speaking the same kind of language, their ideas must seem 
to be utterly opposed. 

If we do not know the ultimate reality, we stand in somewhat the same 
relation to it as blind men to color. If I am to describe color to a blind man, I 
can do it in one of two ways. I can tell him what color is like, or I can say what 
it is not. I cannot possibly tell him what it is. | can compare it to variations in 
temperature, speaking of red as “warm” and blue as “cold,” though this will 
perhaps mislead the blind man into thinking that red is warm. On the other 
hand, I can say that color is not hard or soft, round or square, liquid or solid. 
The danger here is that the blind man may easily suppose that I am talking 
about nothing, for I have denied to color every positive quality that he knows. 

To some extent, this is the difference between the religious doctrines of 
the West and the metaphysical doctrines of Asia. The former wants to say what 
reality is like, and the latter what it is not, but the average mind supposes that 
both are trying to say what it is. Hence the confusion. 

But the negative mode of approach to the ultimate reality involves rather 
more than this, and to understand it properly we must try to see exactly what 
is being negated. Another principle that both the Vedanta and Buddhism hold in 
common is that, in reality, “all this’*—the whole world of experience, including 
myself and others—is in essence identical with sunyata or Brahman. In other 
words, there is no reality but the absolute, nondual, and ultimate reality. This 
is taken to be a radical denial of the everyday world, as if distinct people and 
things had no value or meaning whatsoever. 

It is therefore tremendously important to realize that the negative way 
is not making a negation about reality—about the real “something” that is 
the basis of everyday experience. The denial applies strictly to the ideas, the 
concepts, the theories, and the fixed categories of thought whereby we try to 
understand and grasp what we experience. The metaphysical doctrines of the 
Orient are saying that you cannot grasp reality in any fixed form of thought 
or feeling; you cannot nail it down and possess it. We try to do this because 
almost all of us feel insecure. We have identified our consciousness with a 
seemingly fixed form—a structure of memories called “I.” We discover that this 
structure is impermanent, and are therefore afraid. We therefore cling all the 
more tenaciously to life, to “I,” and become still more afraid, involving ourselves 
in a vicious circle of clinging that is called samsara—the “round” of existence. 

But the real world, which is the basis of everyday experience, cannot be 
“fixed”—and every attempt to do so results in frustration and vicious circles. 


THE NEGATIVE WAY 65 


Yet this world, this reality that we experience at every moment is Brahman. For 
example, I point to a tree and say, “This is a tree.” Obviously this and tree are 
not actually the same thing. Tree is a word, a noise. It is not this experienced 
reality to which I am pointing. To be accurate, I should have said, “This (point- 
ing to a tree) is symbolized by the noise tree.” 

If, then, the real tree is not the word or the idea tree, what is it? If I say 
that it is an impression on my senses, a vegetable structure, or a complex of 
electrons, I am merely putting new sets of words and symbols in place of 
the original noise tree. I have not said what it is at all. I have also raised other 
What is a structure? 
We can never say what these things are. We can symbolize them by sundry 


29 66 29 66 


questions: “What are my senses? What are electrons?” 
noises and patterns of thought. We can, in turn, symbolize these noises by other 
noises—"Tree is a word,” or “A pattern of thought is an idea’—but this does 
not really explain anything. We still do not know what a tree, a word, a noise, 
or an idea actually is. And yet we have experienced mysterious “somethings,” 
which we have arbitrarily paired off with each other—the sight of the tree with 
the noise tree, the process of thinking with the noise idea, and the noises tree 
and idea with the noise words. 

Human beings are very much bewitched by words and ideas. They forget 
that they are mere symbols. They tend to confuse them seriously with the real 
world that they only represent. The reason for this confusion is that the world 
of words and ideas seems to be relatively fixed and rational, whereas the real 
world is not fixed at all. Thus the world of words and ideas seems to be so 
much safer, so much more comprehensible than the real world. The word and 
idea tree has remained fixed currency for many centuries, but real trees have 
behaved in a very odd way. I can try to describe their behavior by saying that 
they have appeared and disappeared, that they have been in a constant state of 
change, and that they flow in and out of their surroundings. 

But this does not really say what they have done, because disappear, change, 
flow, and surroundings are still noises representing something utterly mysterious. 

Our problem, then, is that so long as we try to fit the real world into the 
“nice little, tight little” world of definitions, ideas, and words (nama-rupa), we 
shall never succeed in doing so, save in the most approximate and impermanent 
way. On the other hand, to know Brahman, to see God, is to be aware of the 
real world in its undefined (i.e., infinite) state. This is to know life without trying 
to capture it in the fixed forms of conventional words and ideas. It is only by 
convention that the aspect of reality called man is separated off from all other 
aspects—the earth, the air, the sun, moon and stars. It is convenient to do this 
(which is what “convention” means), but it does not fully correspond to the 
facts, which are that man is a process continuous with every other process, and 
that the boundaries between these processes are fixed arbitrarily by the human 
mind. For example, who is to say whether a man begins and ends with birth 
and death, or with conception and the final decay of his corpse? Is he limited 
in space by his skin, or does he extend out to the distance to which he can 


66 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


hear, smell, and see? All these boundaries are as conventional and arbitrary as 
the length of an inch or the weight of a pound: you can put them anywhere 
you like, so long as you agree about them with others. 

At root, then, to cling to oneself is as absurd as cleaving passionately to 
an inch. It just cannot be done, and the attempt is pure frustration. To say, 
then, that reality is not any particular thing, and that individuals are unreal, 
is in principle exactly the same thing as pointing out that two yards have no 
existence apart from a real piece of cloth or wood. You cannot make a dress 
out of two, or two million, abstract yards. 

We have to learn, then, to take all conventional distinctions and definitions 
for what they are—purely arbitrary and unreal conveniences—and to be keenly 
aware of life as it is (yatha bhutam) apart from all definitions, measurements, 
and arbitrary boundaries. To see the world in this way is to see Brahman, the 
undefinable. In this sense, every one of us has already an obscure and neglected 
knowledge of Brahman—but it is not knowledge in the ordinary meaning of 
the word. Ordinarily, we mean that to know something is to be able to define 
it. In fact, however, we know a whole world that we cannot define at all, but 
we do not make friends with it. We are afraid of it, and are always trying to 
tie it up safely in watertight packages. 

When St. Augustine was asked what time was, he replied, “I know, but 
when you ask me | don’t.” The same is true of reality. We know it all the 
time, but when we begin to think about it, it vanishes. Thus it is said in Zen 
Buddhism, “If you want to see into it, see into it directly. When you begin to 
think about it, it is altogether missed.” For the same reason the Kena Upanishad 
says, “He who thinks that Brahman is not comprehended, by him Brahman 
is comprehended; but he who thinks that Brahman is comprehended knows 
It not. Brahman is unknown to those who know It, and it is known to those 
who do not know It at all.” 

Brahman, then, is the real world as it is in itself, before we begin to describe 
or define it in any way, before we split it asunder into millions of arbitrary 
distinctions called feet, inches, stars, trees, men, ounces, pounds, and mountains. 
A Chinese poem expresses it thus: 


Plucking chrysanthemums along the east fence; 
Gazing in silence at the southern hills; 

The birds flying home in pairs 

Through the soft mountain air of dusk— 

In these things there is a deep meaning, 

But when we are about to express it, 

We suddenly forget the words. 


I know, but when you ask me I don’t. If you want me to show you God, 
I will point to the ash can in your back yard. But if you ask, “Then you mean 
that this ash can is God?”—you will have missed the point altogether. 


CHAPTER THREE 


The Language of Metaphysical Experience 


The Sense of Non-Sense (1953) 


here is an area of human experience for which we do not have any 
really suitable name in our Western languages, for while it is basic 
to such matters as religion, metaphysics, and mysticism, it is not identical with 
any one of them. I refer to the perennial type of experience that is described 
as a more or less immediate knowledge of God, or of the ultimate reality, 
ground or essence of the universe, by whatever name it may be represented.' 

According to the ancient spiritual traditions of both Europe and Asia, 
which include ways of life and thought as widely different as Buddhism and 
Catholicism, this experience is the supreme fulfillment of human life—the goal, 
the final end, toward which human existence is ordered. 

According, however, to modern logical philosophy—scientific empiricism, 
logical positivism, and the like—statements of this kind are simply meaningless. 
While it is admitted that there may be interesting and delightful experiences of 
the “mystical” type, logical philosophy finds it altogether illegitimate to regard 
them as containing any knowledge of a metaphysical character, as constituting 
an experience of “ultimate reality” or the Absolute. 

This critique is based not so much upon a psychological analysis of the 
experience itself as upon purely logical analysis of such universal concepts as 
God, Ultimate Reality, Absolute Being, and the like—all of which are shown to 
be terms without meaning. It is not the purpose of this paper to describe the 
steps of this critique in any detail, since it should be familiar enough to every 
student of modern philosophy, and since there seems no need to take issue 
with the logical argument itself. The starting point of this paper is one which,

68 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


perversely it may seem, regards the basic argument of modern logical philoso- 
phy as a highly important contribution to metaphysical thought—enabling us 
to evaluate the true character and function of metaphysical terms and symbols 
far less confusedly than has hitherto been possible. 

This evaluation, however, is not the sort of devaluation that the individual 
exponents of logical philosophy, such as Russell, Ayer, and Reichenbach, pro- 
pose. For the positive contribution of logical philosophy to metaphysics and 
religion has been obscured by the fact that such exponents were not content 
to be logicians. Because of a certain emotional bias against religious or meta- 
physical points of view, this logical critique has been used as an instrument in 
a polemic, even a propaganda, with emotional rather than logical motivations. 

It is one thing to demonstrate that the concept of Being is without logical 
meaning. It is quite another to go on to say that this, and similar metaphysical 
concepts, are not philosophy but poetry, where the term “poetry” carries a very 
strongly implied pooh-pooh. The implication is that the “poetry” of religious 
and metaphysical symbols may be cause or effect of very exquisite and inspir- 
ing emotional experiences, but these, like “the arts” in wartime, are among 
the nonessentials of life. The serious philosopher regards them as charming 
toys—as means of decorating life, not of understanding it—in somewhat the 
same way as a physician might adorn his office with a medicine mask from 
the South Seas. All this is merely damning with faint praise. 

While the exponents of logical philosophy have, on their side, sought to 
devalue the insights of metaphysics and religion, the would-be defenders of 
Faith have for the most part looked around somewhat ineffectually for means 
of defeating logical philosophy at its own game. On the whole, the more suc- 
cessful counterattack has seemed to be returning one pooh-pooh for another; 
as, for instance, the quip that Ayer, Reichenbach, and company have exchanged 
philosophy for grammar. 

Yet in the context of Western philosophy and religion this situation is not 
at all surprising, for we have always been under the impression that religio- 
metaphysical statements are of the same order as scientific and historical state- 
ments. We have generally taken it for granted that the proposition, “There is 
a God,” is a statement of the same kind as, “There are stars in the sky.” The 
assertion that “all things have being” has always seemed to convey information 
in the same way as the assertion that “all men are mortal.” Furthermore, “The 
universe was made by God” has seemed as much a statement of historical type 
as that “the telephone was invented by Thomas Edison.” 

Dr. F. S. C. Northrop is thus perfectly correct in pointing to the essential 
similarity between science, on the one hand, and the Hebrew-Christian reli- 
gious tradition, on the other, in so far as both are concerned with “truth” as 
a structure of objective reality, whose nature is determinate even if unseen. 
Indeed, the scientific spirit has its historical origins in the type of mentality 
that is concerned to know the supernatural and the unseen in terms of positive 


THE LANGUAGE OF METAPHYSICAL EXPERIENCE 69 


propositions, which wants to know what facts lie beneath the surface of events. 
Thus Christian theology and science stand in somewhat the same historical 
relation as astrology and astronomy, alchemy and chemistry, both constituting 
a body of theory to explain the past and predict the future.’ 

But Christianity did not disappear with the alchemists. Since the rise of 
modern science, theology has played a most problematic role. It has taken many 
different attitudes to science, ranging from denouncing it as a rival doctrine, 
through conciliation and adaptation, to a sort of withdrawal in which it is 
felt that theology speaks of a realm of being inaccessible to scientific inquiry. 
Throughout, there has been the general assumption on the part of both theo- 
logians and scientists that the two disciplines were employing the same kind 
of language, and were interested in the same order of objective, determinate 
truths. Indeed, when some theologians speak of God as having “an objective, 
supernatural reality, independent of our minds and of the sensible world,” it is 
impossible to see how their language differs from that of science. For it appears 
that God is some specific thing or fact—an objective existence—supernatural 
in the sense that he or it is imperceptible within the “wave band” of our sense 
organs and scientific instruments. 

Where this confusion between the nature of religious or metaphysical state- 
ments, on the one hand, and scientific or historical statements, on the other, 
remains unclarified, it will, of course, be difficult indeed to see how modern 
logical philosophy can make any positive contribution to metaphysics. In a 
theological system where God plays the part of a scientific hypothesis, that is, 
a means of explaining and predicting the course of events, it is easy enough to 
show that the hypothesis adds nothing to our knowledge. One does not explain 
what happens by saying that God wills it. For if everything that happens is by 
divine intention or permission, the will of God becomes merely another name 
for “everything that happens.” Upon logical analysis, the statement, “Everything 
is the will of God,” turns out to be the tautology, “Everything is everything.” 

To cut a long story short, thus far the contribution of logical philosophy 
to metaphysics has been entirely negative. The verdict seems to be that, under 
logical scrutiny, the entire body of metaphysical doctrine consists either of tautol- 
ogy or nonsense. But this amounts to a total “debunking” of metaphysics only 
as it has been understood in the West—as consisting of meaningful statements 
conveying information about “transcendental objects.” Oriental philosophy has 
never been of the serious opinion that metaphysical statements convey informa- 
tion of a positive character. Their function is not to denote “Reality” as an object 
of knowledge, but to “cure” a psychological process by which man frustrates 
and tortures himself with all kinds of unreal problems. To the Oriental mind, 
“Reality” cannot be expressed; it can only be known intuitively by getting rid 
of unreality, of contradictory and absurd ways of thinking and feeling. 

The primary contribution of logical philosophy in this sphere is simply the 
confirmation of a point that has long been clear to both Hindus and Buddhists, 


70 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


though perhaps less widely realized in the Christian tradition. The point is that 
the attempt to talk about, think about, or know about the ultimate Reality 
constitutes an impossible task. If epistemology is the attempt to know what 
knows, and ontology the attempt to define “is-ness,” they are clearly circular 
and futile procedures, like trying to bite one’s own teeth. In a commentary on 
the Kena Upanishad, Shankara says: 


Now a distinct and definite knowledge is possible in respect of everything 
capable of becoming an object of knowledge; but it is not possible in 
the case of That which cannot become such an object. That is Brah- 
man, for It is the Knower, and the Knower can know other things, but 
cannot make Itself the object of Its own knowledge, in the same way 
that fire can burn other things but cannot burn itself. 


In the same way the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad says: 


Thou couldst not see the seer of sight, thou couldst not hear the 
hearer of hearing, nor perceive the perceiver of perception, nor know 
the knower of knowledge (iii, 4. 2). 


Or in the words of a Chinese Buddhist poem: 


It is like a sword that wounds, but cannot wound itself; 
Like an eye that sees, but cannot see itself.’ 


A similar difficulty exists for physics in any attempt to investigate the nature 
of energy. For there is a point at which physics, as much as metaphysics, enters 
the realm of tautology and nonsense because of the circular character of the 
task that it attempts—to study electrons with instruments that are, after all, 
electrons themselves. At the risk of quoting a source that is somewhat passé, 
the classical statement of this problem is in Eddington’s (1935) Nature of the 
Physical World: 


We have perhaps forgotten that there was a time when we wanted to be 
told what an electron is. The question was never answered. . . . Some- 
thing unknown is doing we don’t know what—that is what our theory 
amounts to. It does not sound a particularly illuminating theory. I have 
read something like it elsewhere: 


The slithy toves 
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe. 


There is the same suggestion of activity. There is the same indefiniteness 
as to the nature of the activity and of what it is that is acting. (p. 280) 


THE LANGUAGE OF METAPHYSICAL EXPERIENCE Fil 


Eddington (1935) goes on to point out that, despite this indefiniteness, 
physics can “get results” because the electrons, the unknowns within the atom, 
are countable. 


Eight slithy toves gyre and gimble in the oxygen wabe; seven in nitro- 
gen. By admitting a few numbers even “Jabberwocky” may become 
scientific. We can now venture on a prediction: if one of its toves 
escapes, oxygen will be masquerading in a garb properly belonging 
to nitrogen. ... It would not be a bad reminder of the essential 
unknownness of the fundamental entities of physics to translate it 
into “Jabberwocky”; provided all numbers—all metrical attributes—are 
unchanged, it does not suffer in the least. (p. 281) 


The point that emerges is that what we are counting or measuring in 
physics, and that what we are experiencing in everyday life as sense data, is at 
root unknown and probably unknowable. 

At this point modern logical philosophy dismisses the problem, and turns 
its attention to something else on the assumption that the unknowable need not 
and cannot concern us further. It asserts that questions that have neither the 
physical nor the logical possibility of an answer are no real questions. But this 
assertion does not get rid of the common human feeling that such unknowns 
or unknowables as electrons, energy, existence, consciousness, or “Reality” are 
in some way queer. The very fact of not being able to know them makes them 
all the queerer. Only a rather dry kind of mind turns away from them—a mind 
interested in nothing but logical structures. The more complete kind of mind, 
which can feel as well as think, remains to “indulge” the odd sense of mystery 
that comes from contemplating the fact that everything is at base something 
that cannot be known. Every statement that you make about this “something” 
turns out to be nonsense. And what is specially queer is that this unknowable 
something is also the basis of that which otherwise I know so intimately—myself. 

Western man has a peculiar passion for order and logic, such that, for 
him, the entire significance of life consists in putting experience into orders. 
What is ordered is predictable, and thus a basis for “safe bets.” We tend to 
show a psychological resistance to areas of life and experience where logic, 
definition, and order—i.e., “knowledge” in our sense—are inapplicable. For this 
type of mind the realm of indeterminacy and Brownian movements is frankly 
embarrassing, and the contemplation of the fact that everything is reducible to 
something we cannot think about is even disquieting. There is no real “reason” 
why it should be disquieting, because our inability to know what electrons are 
does not seem to interfere with our capacity to predict their behavior in our 
own macroscopic world. 

The resistance is not based on some fear of an unpredictable action, which 
the unknown may produce, although I suspect that even the most hardened 
logical positivist would have to admit to some odd feelings in face of an 


72 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


unknown called death. The resistance is rather the fundamental unwillingness 
of this type of mind to contemplate the limits of its power to succeed, order, 
and control. It feels that if there are areas of life that it cannot order, it is 
surely reasonable (i.e., orderly) to forget them and turn to areas of life that can 
be ordered—so that the sense of success, of the mind’s own competence, can 
be maintained. The contemplation of these intellectual limitations is, for the 
pure intellectual, a humiliation. But for the man who is something more than 
a calculator, the baffling is also the wonderful. In the face of the unknowable 
he feels with Goethe that 


the highest to which man can attain is wonder; and if the prime 
phenomenon makes him wonder, let him be content; nothing higher 
can it give him, and nothing further should he seek for behind it; 
here is the limit. 


In the type of metaphysical or mystical experience that we are discussing, 
this feeling of wonder—which has all kinds of depths and subtleties—is one of 
two major components. The other is a feeling of liberation (the Hindu moksha), 
which attends the realization that an immense amount of human activity is 
directed to the solution of unreal and purely fantastic problems—to the attain- 
ment of goals that we do not actually desire. 

Speculative metaphysics—ontology and epistemology—are the intellectual 
aspects of fantastic problems that are basically psychological, and by no means 
confined to persons of a philosophical or even religious turn of mind. As already 
indicated, the essential nature of this kind of problem is circular—the attempt 
to know the knower, to make fire burn fire. This is why Buddhism speaks of 
release—nirvana—as deliverance from the Wheel, and of seeking Reality as 
“like looking for an ox when you are riding on one.” 

The psychological basis of these circular problems becomes clear when we 
look into the assumptions upon which, for example, the problems of ontology 
are based. What premises of thought and feeling underlie men’s efforts to know 
“being,” “existence,” or “energy” as objects? Clearly, one assumption is that these 
names refer to objects—an assumption that could not have been made if there 
were not beneath it the further assumption that “I,” the knowing subject, am 
somehow different from “being,” the supposed object. If it were perfectly clear 
that the question, “What is being?” is, in the final analysis, the same question 
as “What am I?” the circular and futile character of the question would have 
been obvious from the beginning. But that it was far from clear is shown by 
the fact that metaphysical epistemology could ask that question, “What am I?” 
or “What is that which is conscious?” without recognizing a still more obvious 
circle. Obviously, questions of this order could be taken seriously only because 
of some nonlogical feeling of the need for an answer. 


THE LANGUAGE OF METAPHYSICAL EXPERIENCE 73 


This feeling, common, perhaps, to most human beings, is surely the sense 
that “I,” the subject, am a unique, isolated entity. There would be no need 
whatsoever to wonder what I am unless in some way I felt strange to myself. 
But so long as my consciousness feels strange to, cut off, and separate from 
its own roots, I can feel meaning in an epistemological question that has no 
logical sense. For I feel that consciousness is a function of “I’—not recogniz- 
ing that “I,” the ego, is just another name for consciousness. The statement “I 
am conscious” is, then, a concealed tautology saying only that consciousness 
is a function of consciousness. It can escape from this circularity upon the sole 
condition that “I” is taken to mean very much more than consciousness or its 
contents. But, in the West, this is not a usual use of the word. We identify “I” 
with the conscious will, and do not admit moral authority or responsibility for 
what we do unconsciously and unintentionally—the implication being that such 
acts are not our deeds but merely events that “happen” within us. When “I” is 
identified with “consciousness,” man feels himself to be a detached, separate, 
and uprooted entity acting “freely” in a void. 

This uprooted feeling is doubtless responsible for the psychological inse- 
curity of Western man, and his passion for imposing the values of order and 
logic upon the whole of his experience. Yet while it is obviously absurd to say 
that consciousness is a function of consciousness, there seem to be no means 
of knowing that of which consciousness is a function. That which knows—and 
which psychologists call somewhat paradoxically the unconscious—is never the 
object of its own knowledge. 

Now consciousness, the ego, feels uprooted so long as it avoids and refuses 
to accept the fact that it does not and cannot know its own base or ground. 
But when this is recognized, the consciousness feels connected, rooted, even 
though it does not know to what it is connected, in what it is rooted. So long 
as it retains delusions of self-sufficiency, omni-competence, and individual free 
will, it ignores the unknown on which it rests. By the familiar “law of reversed 
effort,” this refusal of the unknown brings the feeling of insecurity, and in 
its train all the frustrating and impossible problems, all the vicious circles of 
human life, from the exalted nonsense of ontology down to the vulgar realms 
of power politics, where individuals play at being God. The hideous contriv- 
ances of the police (the 100 percent safe and ordered) state for planning the 
planners and guarding the guards and investigating the investigators are simply 
the political and social equivalents of the quests of speculative metaphysics. 
Both alike have their psychological origin in the reluctance of consciousness, 
of the ego, to face its own limits, and to admit that the ground and essence 
of the known is the unknown. 

It does not matter very much whether you call this unknown Brahman 
or Blah, though the latter term usually indicates the intention to forget it, and 
the former to keep it in mind. Keeping it in mind, the law of reversed effort 


74 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


works in the other direction. I realize that my very substance, that which I am, 
is altogether beyond grasping or knowing. It is not “I’—a word that suggests 
that it means something; it is non-sense and no-thing, which is why Mahayana 
Buddhism calls it Tathata, of which a good translation might be “da-da,” and 
Sunyata, the “void” or indeterminate. Similarly the Vedantists say, “Tat tvam 
asi’ —"“That art thou”—without ever giving a positive designation of what that 
is. The man who tries to know, to grasp himself, becomes insecure, just as one 
suffocates by holding one’s breath. Conversely, the man who really knows that 
he cannot grasp himself gives up, relaxes, and is at ease. But he never really 
knows if he simply dismisses the problem, and does not pause to wonder, to 
feel, and to become vividly aware of the real impossibility of self-knowledge. 
To the religious mentality of the modern West, this entirely negative 
approach to Reality is almost incomprehensible, for it suggests only that the 
world is based on the shifting sands of nonsense and caprice. For those who 
equate sanity with order this is a doctrine of pure despair. Yet little more than 
five hundred years ago a Catholic mystic was saying of God, “By love He may 
be gotten and holden, but by thought never,” and that God must be known 
through “unknowing,” through “mystical ignorance” (McCann, 1943).4 And 
the love of which he spoke was not emotion. It was the general state of mind 
that exists when a man, through the realization of its impossibility, is no longer 
trying to grasp himself, to order everything and be dictator of the universe. 
In our own day logical philosophy provides the same technique of nega- 
tion, telling us that in every statement in which we think we have grasped or 
defined or merely designated Reality, we have uttered only nonsense. When 
the tongue tries to put itself into words, the most that may be expected is a 
tongue twister. For this reason, the procedures of logical philosophy will only 
be disquieting to those theologians and metaphysicians who imagine that their 
definitions of the Absolute actually define anything. But it was always perfectly 
clear to the philosophers of Hinduism and Buddhism, and to some fewer 
Tathata,” and “God” meant 
not something but no-thing. They indicated a void in knowledge, somewhat 


29 66) 


Catholic mystics, that words such as “Brahman, 


as a window is outlined by the frame. 

Yet logical philosophy pursues its criticism further, and says that nonsense 
statements and exclamations of this order do not constitute philosophy because 
they contribute nothing to knowledge—by which they mean that they do not 
assist us to predict anything, and offer no directions for human conduct. That 
is, in part, true, though it misses the very obvious point that philosophy— 
wisdom—consists as much in its spaces as in its lines, in recognizing what is 
not and cannot be known as in the contrary. But we must go farther than 
this truism. Knowledge is more than know-how, and wisdom is more than 
predicting and ordering. Human life becomes a fantastic vicious circle when 
man tries to order and control the world and himself beyond certain limits, 


THE LANGUAGE OF METAPHYSICAL EXPERIENCE 75 


and these “negative metaphysics” at least convey the positive injunction to 
relax this excess of effort. 

But beyond this they have a positive consequence that is still more important. 
They “integrate” logic and conscious thought with the indeterminate matrix, 
the non-sense, which we find at the root of all things. The assumption that the 
task of philosophy, as of human life, is fulfilled only in predicting and order- 
ing, and that the “nonsensical” has no value, rests upon a sort of philosophical 
“schizophrenia.” If man’s work is entirely to go to war on chaos with logic, 
to determine the indeterminate; if the “good” is the logical and the “evil” the 
whimsical; then logic, consciousness, and the human brain is in conflict with 
the source of its own life and ability. We must never forget that the processes 
that form this brain are unconscious, and that beneath all the perceptible orders 
of the macroscopic world lies the indeterminate nonsense of the microscopic, 
the “gyring and gimbling” of a “tove” called energy—about which we know 
nothing. Ex nihilo omnia fiunt. But this nothing is a very strange thing. 

Logical philosophy does not seem to have faced the fact that “non-sense” 
terms, so far from being valueless, are essential to every system of thought. 
It would be quite impossible to construct a philosophy or a science that is a 
“closed system” rigorously defining every term that it employs. Gédel has given 
us a clear mathematico-logical proof of the fact that no system can define its 
own axioms without self-contradiction, and, since Hilbert, modern mathematics 
employs the point as an entirely undefined concept. Just as the knife cuts other 
things, but not itself, so thought uses tools that define but cannot be defined; 
logical philosophy itself by no means escapes from this limitation. 

For example, when logical philosophy asserts that “true meaning is a verifi- 
able hypothesis” it must recognize that this very statement is meaningless if 
unverifiable. Similarly, when it insists that the only realities are those “facts” 
that are elicited in “scientific observation,” it must recognize that it cannot, 
and does not, answer the question “What is a fact?” If we say that “facts” or 
“things” are the segments of experience symbolized by nouns, we are merely 
shifting the irreducible element of non-sense in our definition from “fact” to 
“experience.” Some basic non-sense is entirely unavoidable, and the attempt 
to construct a completely self-defining system of thought is a vicious circle 
of tautology. Language can hardly dispense with the word “is,” and yet the 
dictionary can only inform us that “what is” is “what exists,” and that “what 
exists” is “what is.” 

If, then, it must be admitted that even one non-sense, meaningless, or unde- 
fined term is necessary to all thought, we have already admitted the metaphysical 
principle that the basis or ground of all “things” is an indefinable (or infinite) 
no-thing beyond sense—always escaping our comprehension and control. This 
is the supernatural, in the proper sense of what cannot be “natured” or classi- 
fied, and the immaterial in the sense of what cannot be measured, metered, or 


76 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


“mattered.” In all its fullness, this admission is precisely faith—the recognition 
that one must ultimately “give in” to a life-source, a Self beyond the ego, which 
lies beyond the definition of thought and the control of action. 

Belief, in the popular Christian sense, falls short of this faith, since its object 
is a God conceived as having a determinate nature. But to the extent that God 
can be a known object of definite nature, he is an idol, and belief in such a God 
is idolatry. Thus in the very act of demolishing the concept of the Absolute as a 
“what” or “fact” about which meaningful statements and determinations can be 
made, logical philosophy has made its most vital contribution to religious faith—at 
the cost of its antithesis, religious “belief.” While the logical positivists unwit- 
tingly join forces with the Hebrew prophets in their denunciation of idolatry, the 
prophets are found to be in line with that grand metaphysical tradition that, in 
Hinduism and Buddhism, has taken the disuse of idols to its proper conclusion. 

In sum, then, the function of metaphysical “statements” in Hinduism and 
Buddhism is neither to convey positive information about an Absolute, nor to 
indicate an experience in which this Absolute becomes an object of knowledge. 
In the words of the Kena Upanishad: “Brahman is unknown to those who 
know It, and is known to those who do not know It at all.” This knowing of 
Reality by un-knowing is the psychological state of the man whose ego is no 
longer split or dissociated from its experiences, who no longer feels himself as 
an isolated embodiment of logic and consciousness, separate from the gyring 
and gimbling of the unknown. He is thus delivered from samsara, the Wheel, 
the squirrel cage psychology of all those human beings who everlastingly frus- 
trate themselves with impossible tasks of knowing the knower, controlling the 
controller, and organizing the organizer, like Ouroboros, the mixed-up snake, 
who dines off his own tail.

CHAPTER FOUR 


On Philosophical Synthesis (1953) 


ib many respects the formal, academic philosophy of the West has 
come to a dead end, having confined itself to a method of inquiry 
that compels it to move in a vicious circle. This is especially true in epistemol- 
ogy, which, because it involves the whole work of self-knowledge, is really the 
central problem of philosophy. As the West understands it, epistemology is 
really the task of trying to “think thought”—to construct words about words 
about words—since philosophical thinking is, for us, not a changing but a 
verbalization of experience. 

The inquiring mind is perennially fascinated with the problem of the 
mind’s own nature and origins—not only to know just by way of information 
what knowing is, but also to employ such information for the greater control 
of the knower, for is it not frequently said that the problem of modern man is 
to be able to control himself as effectively as he can control his environment? 

But there is a basic contradiction in the attempt of reason to transcend 
itself. To know the knower, to control the controller, and to think thought 
implies a circular and impossible situation, like the effort to bite one’s own 
teeth. It is for this reason that modern logical philosophy tends to dismiss 
such inquiries as “metaphysical and meaningless” and to confine philosophy 
to the investigation of relatively pedestrian problems of logic and ethics. This 
situation has arisen in the West because, for us, “to know” really means “to 
control”; that is, to see how events may be fitted to consistent orders of words 
and symbols so that we may predict and govern their course. But this mania 
for control leads ultimately to a barren confusion, because we ourselves are by

no means separated from the environment we are trying to control. Western 
man has been able to pursue this mania only so far because of his acute feel- 
ing of individual isolation, of the separation of his “I” from all else. Thus, in 
philosophy, in technology, and in the whole ordering of our society, we run into 
the ancient problem of Quis custodiet custodies?—who guards the guard, polices 
the policeman, plans the planner, and controls the controller? The logical end 
of all this is the totalitarian state of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, the 
nightmare of mutual espionage. 

On the other hand, such major Oriental philosophies as the Vedanta, Bud- 
dhism, and Taoism arise in cultures far less concerned with controlling the 
world, and in which the whole notion of the dominance of the universe by 
man (the conscious ego) seems palpably absurd. For all these philosophies it is 
a first principle that the seeming separateness of the ego from the world, so 
that it could be its controller, is an illusion. Individual consciousness did not 
contrive itself and, not being sui generis (un-born, anutpanna), can never be the 
directive source of life. 

Thus, for Oriental philosophy, knowledge is not control. It is rather the 
“sensation” —the vivid realization—that “I” am not this individualized conscious- 
ness alone, but the matrix from which it arises. This knowledge consists, not 
in a verbal proposition, but in a psychological change, similar to that which 
occurs in the cure of a psychosis. One in whom this change has come to pass 
does not attempt to control the world, or himself, by the efforts of his own 
will. He learns the art of “letting things happen,” which is no mere passivity 
but, on the contrary, a creative technique familiar to the activity of many art- 
ists, musicians, and inventers in our own culture, whereby skill and insight are 
found to be the fruits of a certain “dynamic relaxation.” 

It is obvious that a philosophy, a wisdom, which offers deliverance from the 
vicious circle of “controlling the controller” is of immense value to cultures, 
like our own, which are hopelessly confused by their schemes to organize them- 
selves. However, it will be extraordinarily difficult for a wisdom of this kind 
to come within the scope of Western philosophy unless the latter can admit 
that philosophy is more than logic, more than verbalization, to the point where 
philosophy can include the transformation of the very processes of the mind, 
and not simply of the words and symbols that the mind employs.

Philosophy beyond Words (1975) 


y f that whereof one cannot speak, thereof one should remain 

silent.” With these words, published in 1921, Ludwig Wittgenstein 

concluded his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and brought Western philosophy, as 
it had been known, to an end. Thereafter all schools of philosophy should have 
become centers of silent contemplation, as in Yoga or Buddhist meditation. 
But, on the principle of “publish or perish,” even Wittgenstein had to keep on 
talking and writing, for if the philosopher remains silent we cannot tell whether 
he is really working or simply goofing off. But with Wittgenstein intellectu- 
ally respectable and academic Western philosophy became trivial. He showed 
that it could not discuss metaphysics—that the exciting questions of ontology 
and epistemology were meaningless, and that thereafter the philosopher must 
content himself with being simply a sophisticated grammarian or specialist in 
mathematical logic. William Earle (1960) in his witty essay “Notes on the Death 
of a Culture” described the new academic philosopher as a pragmatic nine- 
to-five businessman, going to his office with a briefcase to “do philosophy” in 
the same spirit as an accountant or research chemist. He would not dream of 
wandering out at night to contemplate the stars or to ponder such matters as 
the destiny of man and the final significance of the universe. If he thought he 
could get away with it, he would go about campus in the scientist’s white coat. 
As an adolescent I used to frequent an area in London, near the British 
Museum, where certain shops advertised themselves as purveyors of “philosophi- 
cal instruments.” Imagining that philosophers confined themselves to abstract

thinking and required no other instruments than pen and paper, I was surprised 
to find that these shops sold slide rules, chronometers, microscopes, telescopes, 
and other scientific appliances, and that they were old-fashioned and venerable 
shops surviving from an age when science was called “natural philosophy.” 
Thinking it over, this made sense. For philosophy, as Aristotle had said, begins 
with wonder—so that the true philosopher is a person who is naturally curi- 
ous, who finds that existence is a marvelous puzzle, and who would like to 
find out (in Clerk Maxwell’s childhood phrase) “the particular go of it.” Thus 
if philosophy is an attempt to describe and explain the world, to discover the 
order of nature, it must obviously go on into physics and chemistry, astronomy 
and biology, not to mention mathematics and metamathematics. 

But what is the sense of wonder? On the one hand, it is a sort of aesthetic 
or mystical thrill, like being in love, or as Whitman felt of the planets and 
stars that “the drift of them is grand.” On the other hand, it is an attempt to 
solve the puzzle of translating the pattern of the world into the linear orders 
of words and numbers that can be scanned and controlled by the faculty of 
conscious attention. For there are many of us who do not feel that we know 
anything, or are humanly competent, unless we can make this translation. The 
difficulty is that, from the standpoint of linear thinking and scanning, the natural 
world comprises innumerable variables. Using conscious attention, most people 
cannot keep track of more than three variables at once without using a pencil. 
A skilled organist, using both hands and feet, could manage a six-part fugue. 
But the practical problems of life—of politics, law, ethics, economics, and ecol- 
ogy—involve hundreds of thousands of variables with which the scanning pace 
of conscious attention simply cannot keep up, even when aided by computers. 
What scholar, except perhaps an authority on the manufacture of Japanese swords 
in the sixteenth century, can really keep abreast of the literature in his field? 
How can the President of the United States possibly be informed of all that 
he needs to know? There simply isn’t time to pass one’s eyes along the miles 
of letters and figures required, much less to absorb and make sense of them. 

This is likewise the problem of philosophy, considered as a verbal and con- 
ceptual discipline. As natural philosophy, as a discipline that must always keep 
in mind the findings of the sciences, it cannot keep track of ever more complex 
descriptions of the world’s pattern. It cannot give us a Weltanschauung, a total and 
orderly view of the world, based on masses of intellectually indigestible informa- 
tion. As an attempt to describe or define the nature of being, of consciousness, 
of knowledge, or even of energy or electricity, we find that this can no more 
be done in language than one can obtain an answer by spelling out theological 
questions on the dial of a telephone. Whether spoken or written the word W-A- 
T-E-R neither quenches thirst nor floats a boat, and, in a somewhat similar way, 
verbal efforts to describe existence give no understanding of it because you can’t 
say anything about everything. It would be absurd to say that the universe, as 
a whole, is moving in a certain direction, for this would require some external 


PHILOSOPHY BEYOND WORDS 83 


point of reference, which would, by definition, have to be included in the idea of 
universe. In fact, we cannot even imagine what kind of verbal or mathematical 
answer would satisfy such a question as “What is reality?” 

But does all this mean that philosophy, or basic wondering, has come to a 
dead end? A philosopher, a wondering individual, retains an urgent interest in, 
say, problems of ethics and aesthetics and is not going to stop thinking about 
them. And a metaphysician, even though he knows that he cannot even for- 
mulate his ontological and epistemological questions, will not easily abandon 
his amazement at being and knowing. He feels incomplete, intellectually and 
emotionally hungry, unless he has somehow made sense of being an “is” in 
imminently painful transition to being an “isn’t,” of experiencing himself as a 
complex system of vibrations, as a multiplicity of sensitive tubes, tissues, and 
nerves inevitably doomed to dissolve with the greatest reluctance. He asks, 
“How and why am I in this delectable-horrible situation?” Above all, he wants 
to penetrate whatever it is that is the substantial referent of the word “I.” No 
amount of sophistry will persuade him to set aside these questions of feeling 
and devote himself exclusively to symbolic logic or collecting postage stamps. 

I have said that in the West the preoccupations of most academic phi- 
losophers have become trivial. In the university, departments of philosophy 
are usually underpopulated and removed to obscure offices, and the coveted 
degree Philosophiae Doctor is awarded to people who experiment with rats, 
devise computers, or concoct new drugs. This is not without reason, for I am 
suggesting that, in the West, real philosophy turned into science. To answer 
the question “What is reality?” we had to go beyond talking and thinking to 
empirical experiment, to the use of “philosophical instruments.” But marvelous 
as the development of science has been, those almost ineffable questions are 
still unanswered, and the technologies based on science are seriously threaten- 
ing the continuance of life on this planet. They have amplified—turned up the 
volume on—human behavior, and we are not at all sure that we like ourselves. 

For this reason alone there is still an important place for the philosopher 
as a sort of ombudsman or critic of the applied sciences, and in this sense 
people like Arthur Koestler, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Noam Chomsky, and 
Buckminster Fuller must be considered more relevant philosophers than Carnap, 
Ayer, Reichenbach, and Anscombe—to mention but a few of the hard-core 
academicians. But to any young reader (as of 1972) who has the philosophical 
spirit, the wonder at being, all these names are in the past. I don’t want to say 
obsolete or passé, for they are in the same eternal past as Voltaire and Hegel. 
But today young and philosophically enthusiastic people are reading Herman 
Hesse, Krishnamurti, D. T. Suzuki, Theodore Roszak, Spencer Brown, Fritz Perls, 
Gurdjieff, Thomas Merton, and Baba Ram Dass, or, to go back a long way, 
Meister Eckhart, Lao-Tzu, the I Ching, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Upani- 
shads, Patanjali, and the Bhagavad Gita. (This is just a sample. For verification,

84 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


This odd miscellany of names and titles indicates that the trend of serious 
philosophy in the West is going in the direction of contemplative mysticism, that 
is, to an interior empiricism, which may require such “philosophical instruments” 
as LSD-25, the control of breath (pranayama), or the practice of Zen meditation 
for the direct exploration of consciousness and its varying states. The problem 
is that if man, as amplified by technology, is a self-contradictory, suicidal, and 
nonviable organism, some way must be found of changing or getting beyond 
whatever it is that we mean by the word “I.” It is already clear from the sci- 
ences of biology and ecology that every living organism is a single process or 
field with its environment. But this situation is not ordinarily reflected or expe- 
rienced in our normal self-consciousness or sense of identity, wherein we still 
seem to be isolated centers of sensitivity and activity inside bags of skin. But 
if one were to feel one’s existence as the organism-environment process, which 
the biologists and ecologists describe, one would be having an experience of 
“cosmic consciousness” or of identity with the total energy of the universe as 
described by the mystics. The “peak experiences” of an Eckhart, Ramakrishna, 
Hakuin, or (interestingly enough) Schrédinger (1964) and all the accounts of 
these changes of consciousness given by James (1936), Bucke (1959), and Johnson 
(1959) would seem to be vividly sensuous apprehensions of our existence as the 
biologists and ecologists describe it in their theoretical languages. The mystic is 
therefore feeling himself-and-the-world as it is accurately described by scientists, 
in somewhat the same way as, by informed use of a telescope, one can get 
the feel of one’s place in the solar system and the galaxy, or as by frequent air 
travel one really knows that the earth is a globe. 

Now the mystic tells us things that really do not make sense when put into 
words: that what we do and what happens to us are actually the same process, 
as are also something and nothing, solid and space; that as the stars shine out 
of space the world emerges immediately from the Void in an eternal now of 
which the past is merely the wake or echo, not the cause; that this Void is in 
fact one’s basic self, but is felt as emptiness in the same way as the head is a 
blank to the eyes; that each one of us is therefore an aperture through which 
the universe knows itself, but not all of itself, from a particular point of view; 
that death is the same total blankness (i.e., our self) from which we emerged 
at birth, and that what happened once can always happen again. And so on. All 
this means nothing to a literate intellectual of a Western industrial culture in 
the same way that descriptions of color, light, and darkness are meaningless to 
the congenitally blind, or that the most ingenious comments of a music critic 
give no impression of the sound of a concert. 

But this literate intellectual is “blind” only because of the idée fixe that 
the intelligible is only what can be said. Surely I know how to breathe even if 
I cannot describe the full physiology of the process. Furthermore, I learned 
how to swim not by reading about it in a book but by getting into the water 
and following certain instructions. Thus, as Spencer Brown (1969) has pointed 


PHILOSOPHY BEYOND WORDS 85 


out, one may go beyond Wittgenstein’s limit by analogy with music and 
mathematics. We cannot say (describe in words) the sounds of music, but by a 
convenient notation we can instruct a person what to do with a certain instru- 
ment—instruction of the same kind as “drop a perpendicular” or “describe a 
circle” in geometry (pp. 77-79). 

Thus in the pursuit of philosophy as a purely verbal discipline Wittgenstein 
made it clear that because there is no way of answering such questions as 
“What is reality?” one must regard them as false problems and consign them 
to silence. But he did not follow his own advice. By “silence” he seemed to 
mean ignoring or dismissing, and changing the subject of discourse. But if the 
philosopher, still agog in his heart with the metaphysical question that he can- 
not formulate in meaningful words, were to follow Wittgenstein’s instruction 
more literally, what then? He would actually be silent. He would not only (at 
least for a time) stop talking, but also stop thinking, by which I mean talking 
and figuring to oneself sub voce. He would hear, see, touch, taste, and smell 
without comment or judgment, without any attempt to translate the experi- 
ence into words. If words came into his mind automatically and compulsively, 
he would listen to them as mere noise, or get rid of them by humming the 
meaningless sound “Ah!” He would then be in a state to know reality directly 
so that he would no longer need to ask what it is—i.e., into what verbally 
labeled class it should be put. 

Remaining in this state, he might marvel at how many things there are 
that aren’t so. He would have no sensation of himself as an ego or observer 
separate from the whole field of his experience. He would have no perception 
of anything that is past or future—only of a vibrant eternal now, which, when 
felt with the ears alone, would be heard as emerging immediately from silence 
and nothingness. Discussing it later with colleagues who had made the same 
experiment, he might agree that our normal view of life is backward: that the 
present does not follow from the past, but the past from the present, streaming 
away like a contrail. Having really felt what it is to breathe, he might realize 
that the distinction between the voluntary and the involuntary is arbitrary—to 
the evaporation of the problems of free will and determinism. But he would 
genuinely have had to come to the state where verbal thinking has stopped, 
and consciousness remains bright and clear. He would then be practicing what 
is Sanskrit is called dhyana, in Chinese ch’an, and in Japanese zen, and which 
may approximately be translated “idealess contemplation.” 

Characteristically, when the professional philosopher hears about this he 
begins to think up objections without trying the experiment. For he may be 
sure that not-thinking is a vacuous, anti-intellectual mindlessness from which 
no good can come, not realizing that if one thinks all the time, there is noth- 
ing to think about except thoughts—which is rather like incessant talking 
without listening. The health of the intellectual life requires precisely that there 
be pauses in it, and not merely such diversions as sleep, physical exercise, or 


86 LANGUAGE AND MYSTICISM 


carousal, Academic philosophers tend to be scholastics like the theologians who 
refused to look through Galileo’s telescope. As natural philosophy developed 
instruments to explore the external world, theoretical philosophy needs instru- 
ments, or at least experiments, to explore and feel the nonverbal world—if for 
nothing else than to stop confusing the world as it is with the world as it is 
represented in common language. W. Pagel (1935, p. 97) and Joseph Needham 
(1956, pp. 89-98) have documented the collaboration of natural philosophers 
(scientists) and mystics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in their com- 
mon opposition to scholastic rationalism and their common interest in the 
empirical approach, for the mystic wants to go beyond doctrine and dogma, 
beyond belief, to the actual experience of the Ground of Being—to use Paul 
Tillich’s decontaminated phrase for God. 

This means, then, that philosophy in and of the schools must turn (and in 
some places is turning) to what have been called spiritual disciplines, though 
(and I think properly) without commitment to any doctrinal system. In fact, 
beliefs are obstacles to dhyana because consciousness must be clear of thoughts. 
American and British philosophers, with characteristic pragmatism, will of 
course ask what good this will do, and whether it will provide directives for 
behavior. But the apparent paradox of dhyana is that if one is doing it for a 
result, one is not doing it, since its essential attitude is to be aware of what is, 
not what should or might be. In the same way, a musical performer becomes 
self-conscious and awkward if he worries about what effect he is having on his 
audience, and thus the results of dhyana, are always unintentional. Egocentricity, 
for example, diminishes without any self-frustrating egocentric intention to get 
rid of it. Furthermore, the temporary suspension of conscious thought acts in 
somewhat the same way as “sleeping on” a problem, for it frees the brain as a 
whole to analyze it, replacing the linear scanning of conscious attention. As is 
well known, the brain, below the level of consciousness, regulates the myriad 
variables of our organic processes without thinking. Brain operation, unhindered 
by conscious effort, is obviously the source of the astonishing performances of 
lighting calculators, and there seems no reason why such subliminal cogitation 
should not be effective in being addressed to highly complex social, ethical, 
and legal questions. After all, it is well recognized in the legal profession that a 
good judge must not only know the law as written; he must also have a sense 
of equity—that is, a mysterious sense of fair play that no one has ever been 
able to define, although we recognize it at once when we see it. Such a judge 
cannot teach equity because, like even the greatest neurologists, he does not 
understand his own brain, for the order of the brain is so much more complex 
than what Northrop Frye has called the order of words.' 

But I think it must be understood that the order of the brain is complicated 
because, and only because, we are trying to translate it into words. If I may 
invent a verb, the more we try to “precise” the world, to discern its clearly cut 
structure, the more precise we compel ourselves to be. The world retreats into 


PHILOSOPHY BEYOND WORDS 87 


ever greater complexity by analogy with the whirlings of a dog chasing its own 
tail, and, as Spencer Brown (1969) has put it, “In this sense, in respect of its 
own information, the universe must expand to escape the telescopes through 
which we, who are it, are trying to capture it, which is us” (p. 106). In this 
game of trying to control the controller and guard the guards, the philosophers 
and scientists, the lawyers and generals, are compulsively locked. Make almost 
any statement to a logical positivist or scientific empiricist, and he will say, 
of the first word or phrase in your statement, that he does not know what 
you mean. He forces you to define it more precisely, and then pulls the same 
stunt on whatever definition you give him . . . ad infinitum. In the same way, 
the law complicates itself out of manageability by trying to define itself, and 
security systems become hopelessly paranoid in trying to secure themselves. 
To the degree that you make an object of the subject, the subject becomes 
objectionable. The end is suicide. 

To the extent, then, that professional philosophers have locked themselves 
into a word game, to define definition, they cannot be said to be lovers of 
wisdom. They will reason, endlessly, about reasoning; calculate about calculat- 
ing; talk about talking until no one can keep track of it. This does not mean 
that no more philosophical books can be written or discussions held. There 
must simply be something to write and talk about, other than writing and 
talking, and we can write and talk meaningfully only of shared experiences. 
Thus to have anything to discuss among themselves philosophers must become 
contemplatives, and mystics in the strict sense (Greek muein) of those who, at 
least sometimes, keep silent—not only vocally but also in their heads. Every 
so often the philosopher must become again as a child, and contemplate the 
world as if he knew nothing about it, had no names for it and no idea of 
what is happening. This is an essential cathartic for the intellectual: to listen 
directly to the universe as one listens to classical music, without asking what it 
means. This is Yoga (Sanskrit yuj = Latin jungere) in the sense of being joined 
to or one with what is going on. Patanjali’s definition, yogas chitta vrtti nirodha, 
means approximately that Yoga is silence of the mind, and this is the way that 
Western philosophy must go if we are to take Wittgenstein’s aphorism as a 
positive direction. 


NOTE 


1. Put simply—by Young (1960) and in a highly sophisticated way by Pribram 
(1971)—it is amazing to see how what really amounts to subjective idealism can be stated 
in neurophysical terms. The structure of the nervous system (which we do not really 
understand) determines our view of the world and yet is itself, presumably, something 
in that world. Which comes the first, egg or hen? And what do I mean by “I” in saying 
“I do not understand my nervous system,” which is presumably what I really and truly 
am? The limitation of philosophy is that you can’t kiss your own lips, which is another 
way of saying, with the Upanishads, TAT TVAM ASI, or “You're IT.”

PART TWO 


Buddhism and Zen 


CHAPTER SIX 


The Problem of Faith and Works 
in Buddhism (1941) 


[ is generally assumed that philosophic Buddhism, and especially 
that form of it expressed in the Pali Canon, is par excellence the 
way to salvation or illumination by self-help. For in the philosophy attributed 
to Gautama by the earliest records no place is given to a God or gods who 
can assist man in the development of spiritual life; the existence of such divine 
beings is not denied—it is ignored on the ground that no power on earth or 
in heaven can interfere with another’s karma. And karma (Pali, Kamma) is a 
very inclusive term, for primarily it means “action” or “doing,” though in a 
secondary sense it has come to mean the law of cause and effect—a sense that 
has been much overemphasized by Western theosophical interpretations. But 
it would seem that original Buddhism does not only set aside the possibility 
of interference with karma for the reason that it is impossible to separate a 
cause from its effect (in the Christian sense of absolution). It also rejects the 
possibility of divine intervention at the causal end of the process, having no 
parallel to the Christian concept of Grace. In Christianity there is no human 
power which can, of its own resources, make for righteousness and salvation, 
for by reason of original sin it is impossible for man to move upward without 
the gift of divine Grace. Buddhism, however, would appear to be a method of 
lifting oneself up by one’s own belt, for according to a famous passage in the 
Maha-parinibbana Sutta (v. ii, 27-35), we are advised, “Be ye lamps unto your- 
selves. Be ye a refuge unto your selves. Take to yourselves no other refuge.”’ 

Both Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism in the historical development of 
their philosophy and practice have, for the most part, kept to this principle of

absolute self-reliance. If any faith was involved, it was faith in one’s own capacity 
to work out one’s own salvation, and faith in the ability of Buddhism to supply 
the necessary method. In the Hinayana system the method was to exhaust the 
process of karma by perceiving the fundamental unreality of the individual 
(atta) who sets karma in motion. The Mahayana followed a variation of the 
same method, but, under the influence of Brahmanic thought, supplemented 
the idea of individual unreality with the concept of a universal, nondual Reality 
similar to the Vedantist idea of Brahman. In one sense this Reality, called by 
such names as Tathata, Sunyata, and Dharmakaya, was beyond karma (akarma), 
and thus the realization that it alone existed involved deliverance from the toils 
of karma, even though one might continue to live in the “world of birth-and- 
death.” But the radical nondualism of, say, the Lankavatara Sutra (Suzuki, 1932) 
refused even to make any absolute distinction between karma and akarma, the 
world of illusion and the principle of Reality, the transient, separate individual 
and the eternal, undifferentiated “Suchness” (Tathata): 


There is no Nirvana except where is Samsara; there is no Samsara 
except where is Nirvana; for the condition of existence is not of a 
mutually-exclusive character. Therefore, it is said that all things are 
non-dual as are Nirvana and Samsara. (p. 67) 


The problem of faith and works in Buddhism, as we shall discuss it, will 
be entirely in terms of the Mahayana school. To understand its doctrinal and 
psychological background we must pay particular attention to the Mahayanist 
doctrine of nonduality, bearing also in mind that only in Mahayana has a way 
of salvation by faith arisen. Our attention will be directed, however, to doctrinal 
and psychological aspects of the problem rather than historical, for we cannot 
say precisely whether the historical development of the way of faith came as a 
logical result of certain philosophic trends or as an answer to a natural human 
need. Furthermore, the historical aspect of the problem is complicated by our 
uncertainty as to the exact age of many of the important sutras involved. But 
we do know that the way of faith developed quite early in Mahayana history, 
playing an important role in the works of such early patriarchs of the school 
as Nagarjuna, Asvaghosa, and Vasubandhu. 

Mahayana philosophy is centered upon two closely related ideas. The 
first, descended from Vedanta, is that Enlightenment (the Buddhist life-goal) 
consists in an inner realization of nonduality. All those things upon which 
unenlightened man depends for his happiness are dual, and thus conditioned 
by their opposites. Life cannot be had without death, pleasure without pain, joy 
without sorrow, youth without age, or good without evil. We cannot, therefore, 
depend for our ultimate salvation and security upon any one aspect of a given 
pair of opposites (dvandva), for the two are as essential to each other as back 
and front are essential to the totality of any object. Thus, while we look to 


THE PROBLEM OF FAITH AND WORKS IN BUDDHISM 93 


such limited states for our salvation, we are involved in a world of ups and 
downs that goes under the general name of Samsara, the wheel of birth and 
death. 

From the beginning, the purpose of Buddhism was to find deliverance 
from this wheel, to discover the state of Nirvana, differing from these limited 
states by being eternal, unchanging, and subject to no ups and downs. In the 
Pali Canon there is no special emphasis upon the nonduality of Nirvana. It is 
here something quite outside and different from Samsara—an escape. But the 
Mahayanist Nirvana is described in much the same language as the Upanishads 
describe Brahman, the “One-without-a-second.” Here Nirvana is the experi- 
ence that differs from all these limited experiences by having no opposite. The 
Mahayana sutras are at such pains to stress the nonduality of Nirvana and 
Enlightenment (bodhi) that they do not even allow Nirvana to be opposed to 
Samsara, or Enlightenment to be opposed to Ignorance (avidya). To the fully 
enlightened man Samsara is Nirvana; ordinary, everyday experience of the world 
of opposites is for him transformed into the supreme spiritual experience of 
deliverance or freedom. 

The second important principle of Mahayana is the Bodhisattva-ideal. In 
one sense the Bodhisattva is a lesser Buddha. In another, he is one who, by 
patient striving throughout countless incarnations, has attained the right to 
Nirvana, but who postpones final entry into its eternal rest in order to come 
back into the world and work for the liberation of “all sentient beings.” But 
this rather picturesque view of the Bodhisattva is actually taken from the 
Hinayana standpoint. Nirvana is still an escape from Samsara, even though 
the Bodhisattva has temporarily renounced it. But from the thoroughgoing 
Mahayana standpoint, the Bodhisattva-ideal is the necessary consequence of a 
philosophy denying the duality of Nirvana and Samsara. The Bodhisattva has 
no need to escape from Samsara because he realizes that it is Nirvana. Thus, 
to quote the Lankavatara Sutra again, 


those who, afraid of sufferings rising from the discrimination of birth- 
and-death, seek for Nirvana, do not know that birth-and-death and 
Nirvana are not to be separated the one from the other; and, seeing 
that all things subject to discrimination have no reality, imagine that 
Nirvana consists in the future annihilation of the senses and their fields. 
They are not aware... of the fact that Nirvana is the Alayavijnana 
(universal mind). . . . (Suzuki, 1932, p. 55) 


But whatever the view of Nirvana, the Bodhisattva is the savior, the one 
who makes vows (pranidhana) to postpone any final withdrawal from the world 
until he has seen all living things liberated and raised to the level of his own 
understanding. Thus, in a number of Buddhist sects, the monk repeats daily 
the following vows to identify himself with the Bodhisattva-ideal: 


94 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


How innumerable sentient beings are, I vow to save them all; 

How inexhaustible our evil passions are, I vow to exterminate them; 

How immeasurable the holy doctrines are, I vow to study them; 

How inaccessible the path of Buddhas is, I vow to attain it. (Suzuki, 
1927, p. 323) 


But it will be noted that, although the monk vows to save all sentient beings, 
he does not seem to expect anyone to save him. The remainder of his vows 
are firm affirmations of self-help, and this is in line with the main trend of 
Mahayana philosophy and practice in all but the popular sects, which have put 
the Bodhisattvas in the position of saviors to be worshipped and relied upon 
almost exactly as the Christian relies upon the saving power of the Christ. Thus 
there would seem here to be a huge inconsistency between popular and philo- 
sophic Buddhism in the Mahayana school. The purpose of this study, however, 
is to show that this inconsistency is more apparent than real. 

In modern China and Japan, by far the most popular form of Buddhism 
is a way of salvation by faith. It has attained its most radical and interesting 
development in Japan, but, as we have seen, its origins are in India, far back 
in the early days of Mahayana history. Most students of Buddhism are at a 
loss to find any true similarity of purpose between these popular cults and 
the highly self-reliant Buddhism of Gautama and philosophic Mahayana. They 
are generally regarded as a mere degeneration of the creed, a pure concession 
to unregenerate human nature, which demands supernatural beings to achieve 
what men are too lazy and too frightened to achieve for themselves. There is 
no doubt whatever that there are plenty of lazy and frightened human beings 
and that an easy method of salvation by faith would naturally appeal to them, 
especially in the more extreme forms which altogether discount the efficacy 
of works. But there are other considerations, and from a certain point of 
view these very extreme forms become full of the deepest interest. Here let 
it be said that I owe this point of view to Dr. D. T. Suzuki (1939), who has 
recently made a particularly suggestive study of the philosophy and psychology 
underlying the Buddhism of faith. But as yet he has made no thorough study 
of the psychological relations of the way of faith and the way of works.’ This 
seems to me a very necessary line of inquiry, because I believe that Western 
students of Christian background can never really understand the Buddhism of 
works unless they approach it through the Buddhism of faith, itself so close 
to Christian belief. 

Generally speaking, the Buddhism of faith is founded upon the Sukhavativyuha 
Sutra which, so far as we know, was compiled some three hundred years after 
Gautama’s death. The Sukhavativyuha tells of one Dharmakara, who, in some 
immeasurably distant age, made forty-eight vows concerning the liberation of 
sentient beings. Before making these vows he had devoted himself, for an equally 
incomprehensible span of time, to innumerable good works, thus acquiring for 


THE PROBLEM OF FAITH AND WORKS IN BUDDHISM 95 


himself a store of merit sufficient to give abundant aid to the whole world. But 
he renounced the reward of Highest Attainment due to him for these works, in 
order that he might preside over the Buddha-land (Buddha-kshetra) of Sukhavati, 
the Western Paradise, and there watch over the world until all living beings 
had been born into his Pure Land and thus assured of final illumination. From 
then on he was known as the Buddha Amitabha (Boundless Light) or Amitayus 
(Eternal Life). The Chinese form of the name is O-mi-to-fo, and the Japanese is 
Amida, by which he is most generally known. In the second part of the sutra 
it is declared that those who, in complete faith, turn towards Amida and repeat 
his name will be born after death into his Pure Land. 

But it is hard to find in the sutra itself sufficient ground for some of the 
later interpretations put upon it, and it was not until the time of the Japanese 
Amidist, Shinran Shonin, that there evolved a real philosophy of salvation by 
pure faith. In the sutra, Amida is able to transfer his merit to others because, 
according to the philosophy represented by the Avatamsaka Sutra, each single 
atom contains in itself the whole universe. Therefore, what is done by one 
individual effects all others; if one man raises himself, he raises at the same 
time the whole universe. But here Amida is not the sole source of merit as the 
Christian God is the sole source of goodness. In early Mahayana the transfer- 
ence of merit (parinamana) is a process that may operate mutually between all 
beings, and, though the individual is helped by sharing Amida’s merit, he is yet 
able to acquire merit by his own unaided efforts, thus adding his own contribu- 
tion to a universal store. Thus, in the Sukhavativyuha the possibility of self-help 
is by no means excluded, and Amida remains one among many Buddhas; he 
is not yet raised to the position of sole source of light and life and made the 
personification par excellence of the final, supreme Reality. His distinction is 
just that he has made a particularly large contribution to the store of merit 
in which all may share, and has put his buddha-kshetra at the disposal of all 
who seek it in faith. There is still the difference between in faith and by faith. 

The growth of a cult around Amida was supported by a prevalent view 
that in this dark cycle (kali yuga) of history it is impossible for anyone to attain 
Enlightenment here on earth, although some progress might be made toward 
it. Hence the advantage of being born after death into a realm unencumbered 
by the snares and impurities of earthly life in its dark cycle. And here we are 
able to note either a rationalization of pure laziness or else the growth of 
what Christianity calls the conviction of sin, the realization of man’s impotence 
apart from God. There is, moreover, a remarkable parallel to this gradual break 
from the legalistic, ethical self-reliance of Buddhism in St. Paul’s revolt against 
the Jewish law—and for similar psychological reasons. Thus, in the seventh 
chapter of his Epistle to the Romans St. Paul writes, “Nay, I had not known sin, 
but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt 
not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all 
manner of concupiscence.” 


96 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


In just the same way there were Buddhists who found that the rigid 
morality of monkhood, with its insistence on the negative precept, served 
only to aggravate the inner desire for vice. They found themselves in a spiri- 
tual impasse, unable to change themselves because the self that had to be 
changed was also the self that had to do the changing—a feat as impossible 
as kissing one’s own lips. Certainly a deep insight into the psychology of the 
Lankavatara and the Avatamsaka would have shown a way out of the impasse, 
a way that many of the self-help school discovered (as will be shown) but 
that many more missed. The trouble was not in the peculiar difficulties of 
that psychology, but in the obstacles to be overcome before one could get a 
glimpse of it. It lay hidden under a vast metaphysical structure, which those 
unendowed with considerable powers of intellect could not penetrate, sifting 
the grain from the chaff. And even then they might be left with a grain that 
mere intellect could not appreciate. 

It was, therefore, not surprising that Far Eastern Buddhism revolted in two 
quite distinct ways from a combination of metaphysics and self-discipline that 
might have been endurable separately, but hardly together. The first revolution 
was against the metaphysics, and this gave birth to the Chinese school of Ch’an 
(Japanese, Zen) whose profound intuitive grasp of the essentials of Mahayana 
made its ponderous intellectualism unnecessary. Zen discovered a way of com- 
municating the meaning without the words, and for once the Mahayana became, 
in practice, a psychology and a religion as distinct from a philosophy. But in 
doctrine and discipline Zen remained essentially a way of self-help. The real 
revolution against absolute reliance on works and self-discipline came last of 
all, in Japan. Its leader was Shinran Shonin (1173-1262), a disciple of the great 
Pure Land (Jodo) teacher, Honen Shonin. 

Prior to Shinran, the Pure Land school had been only partially a way of 
salvation by faith, and even today there are two distinct forms of Pure Land 
Buddhism in Japan—Jodo-shu and Shin-shu, the former still placing a consid- 
erable emphasis on the efficacy of works. Thus Japanese Buddhism is divided 
into the two great divisions of jiriki (selfpower) and tariki (other-power), the 
way to Enlightenment by self-reliance and the way by reliance on the Original 
Vow (purvapranidhana) of Amida. Under jiriki we include the Zen, Shingon, 
Tendai, Kegon, and Nichiren schools, under tariki the Shin, while Jodo comes 
more or less in between, though with a list to tariki.’ 

Shinran began his Buddhist studies at the famous community of Mount 
Hiyei, near Kyoto, where he attained a rank of some importance. But, in spite 
of such attainments, he was overwhelmed by the moral problem, recognizing 
that in his heart he was no better than the merest novice. He was deeply con- 
scious of his humanity and keenly aware that mere self-discipline was wholly 
inadequate to deliver him from the bondage of karma. Trying to work out 
karma with self-discipline was like trying to pick up soap with wet fingers; 
the harder you grasp, the faster the soap slips away. (The analogy is mine, not

Shinran’s.) More than any of his predecessors, he felt conscious of the over- 
whelming bondage of earthly life in its present cycle, and, as a man of feeling 
rather than intellect, he was finally attracted to the bhakti-marga of Pure Land 
in the person of Honen Shonin (1133-1212). To Honen he unburdened his 
mind, and was advised to put his trust in Amida and to abandon the monkish 
life by marrying. Subsequently, Shin priests have never vowed celibacy. Shinran 
did not remain in the Pure Land school to which Honen belonged; he founded 
his own school to preserve the purity of a faith which he felt that ordinary 
Jodo priests did not fully understand. 

There are two principle features of Shinran’s religion. The first is his 
conception of parinamana, or merit transference. For him, Amida was the sole 
and original source of merit. Birth in the Pure Land was no longer a question 
of directing one’s own store of merit toward Amida—as a strictly accurate 
reading of the Sukhavativyuha would indicate. Shinran turned the sense of the 
words, making birth in the Pure Land dependent on Amida’s turning his store 
of merit towards the individual. The second feature arises from the first, and 
is the doctrine of pure faith. According to Shinran, no possible human merit 
could ever earn the tremendous right of birth in the Pure Land, and to imagine 
that so great a blessing could ever be claimed as the just reward for human 
effort was to him the height of spiritual pride. In the light of Amida’s infinite 
compassion (karuna), all beings, whether worms, demons, saints or sinners, were 
equally deserving of love, as if Amida would say, “I have the same feeling for 
the high as for the low, for the just as for the unjust, for the virtuous as for 
the depraved, for those holding sectarian views and false opinions as for those 
whose beliefs are good and true.” Those who would put faith in Amida must 
therefore offer themselves to him just as they are, not imagining that the Pure 
Land can ever be a reward for human virtue. Amida’s love is not to be earned; 
it is as much universal property as the sun, moon, and stars—something to 
be accepted with humility and gratitude, but never measured against human 
merit. Thus Shinran said: 


You are not to imagine that you would not be greeted by Amida in his 
Land because of your sinfulness. As ordinary beings you are endowed 
with all kinds of evil passions and destined to be sinful. Nor are you 
to imagine that you are assured of birth in the Pure Land because of 
your goodness. As long as your jiriki sense is holding you, you would 
never be welcomed to Amida’s true Land of Recompense. (Suzuki, 
1939, p. 253) 


All that is necessary is to give up forever any idea of attaining merit by 
one’s own power, and then to have faith that one is accepted by the compas- 
sion of Amida from the very beginning, no matter what one’s moral condition. 
One must even give up the idea that faith itself is achieved by self-power, for 


98 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


faith, too, is Amida’s gift. Thus man as man becomes spiritually passive and, 
by Amida’s grace, lets the eternal love flow into him and save him just as he 
is, symbolizing his faith by repeating the nembutsu, the formula Namu Admida 
Butsu (Hail, Amida the Buddha!). According to the Anjin-ketsujo-sho, 


To understand the Vow means to understand the Name, and to 
understand the Name is to understand that when Amida, by bringing 
to maturity his Vow and Virtue (or Deed) in the stead of all beings, 
effected their rebirth even prior to their actual attainment. (Suzuki, 1939, 
p. 249, italics added)* 


The fact that Amida himself is the sole source of grace is further stressed in 
this passage quoted from Shinran in the Tannisho (Ch. VIII): 


The Nembutsu is non-practice and non-goodness for its devotees. It is 
non-practice because he does not practice it at his own discretion, and 
it is non-goodness because he does not create it at his own discretion. 
All is through Amida’s power alone, not through our own power, 
which is in vain. (Fujimoto, 1932, p. 10) 


At first sight it would seem that the efficacy of Shin depends upon certain 
supernatural sanctions of a kind that ordinary jiriki Buddhists would have great 
difficulty in believing. Such difficulties will always be experienced while Shin is 
studied in terms of its theology, for to anyone but a Christian it would seem 
the merest wishful thinking. For it amounts to this: that it is possible to become 
virtually a Buddha by pure faith. According to Suzuki (1939), 


being born in Amida’s Land means no more than attaining enlighten- 
ment—the two terms are entirely synonymous. The ultimate end of 
the Shin life is enlightenment and not salvation. (p. 264)’ 


Thus Shin devotees refer to their dead as Mi hotoke, or “Honorable Bud- 
dhas.” But as soon as we examine the psychology of Shin as distinct from its 
theology, it becomes possible to relate it to the deepest experiences of Mahayana 
as expressed, for instance, in the Lankavatara and in some of the writings of 
Zen teachers, notably the Lin-chi-lu (Japanese, Rinzai-roku). For we have to ask 
not what Shin believes, but what are the causes and results of that belief in 
terms of inner feeling, of those inner spiritual experiences which words alone 
can never fully communicate. 

For example, let us take the case of any person acutely aware of his short- 
comings, his fears, desires and passions, his lack of insight, and of any sense 
of union or harmony with the life of the universe—in fact, just such a man 
as Shinran. Then someone tells him that, if only he will open his eyes and see 


THE PROBLEM OF FAITH AND WORKS IN BUDDHISM 99 


it, he is a Buddha (is saved by Amida) just as he is, and that any attempt to 
make himself into a Buddha by his own ingenuity is rank spiritual pride. By 
adopting jiriki he is ignoring what is offered to him from the very beginning by 
the laws of the universe, and is trying to manufacture it for himself, so that he 
can take the credit for having earned it. When we say that a man is a Buddha 
just as he is, what does this mean in terms of psychology? It means that he 
is divine or fundamentally acceptable just as he is, whether saint or sinner, sage 
or fool. In Amidist language we would say that he is accepted for birth in the 
Pure Land by Amida’s compassion, which is “no respecter of persons”—in other 
words, that man is given the sense of freedom to be what he is at this and any 
moment, free to be both the highest and the lowest that is in him. This results 
at once in a great relaxation of psychic tension. All self-powered striving and 
contriving (hakarai) is set aside in the realization that Buddhahood can neither 
be attained nor gotten rid of because it alone is. For, in Mahayanist nondual- 
ism, the Buddha principle, Tathata, has no opposite and is the only Reality. 
And while the Anjin says that Amida effected our rebirth into the Pure Land 
“even prior to actual attainment,” the Lankavatara says that, if they realized it, 
all beings are in Nirvana from the very beginning. Here are two doctrines, but 
one psychological experience. 

In practical terms this experience is one of exhilarating spiritual freedom, 
amounting almost to the sanctification of ordinary, everyday life. For, when man 
feels free to be all of himself, there is a magic in every littlest act and thought. 
Thus the Zen poet, Hokoji, says: 


How wondrous strange and how miraculous, this— 
I draw water and I carry fuel. 


One cannot resist quoting Herbert from the Christian standpoint: 


All things of Thee partake; 

Nothing can be so mean 

But with this tincture “For Thy Sake” 
Shall not grow bright and clean. 


A servant with this clause 

Makes drudgery divine; 

Who sweeps a room as for Thy laws 
Makes that and the action fine... . 


This is the famous stone 
That turneth all to gold, 
For that which God doth touch and own 
Can not for less be told. 


100 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


This experience may be clarified and related more closely to the jiriki way 
by further consideration of the Lankavatara and the writings of certain Zen 
teachers. It will now be clear that Shinran’s faith has a right to be considered 
as philosophic Mahayana expressed in rather colorful, symbolic imagery, even 
though it appears to be quite dualistic in conception. Philosophic Mahayana 
would not allow the dualism of self and other, man and Amida; but, if it 
is followed far enough, Shin arrives in experience at what Mahayana states 
in philosophy—although complete nonduality is actually beyond philosophic 
description. Furthermore, the Lankavatara insists that Samsara, the world of 
life and death, is Nirvana, and Samsara just as it is, with all its pain and suffer- 
ing. So, too, Shinran insists that we are saved by Amida just as we are, with all 
our imperfections. In other words, ordinary men are Buddhas just as they are, 
and, according to Hui-neng, of the Zen school, those whom we call Buddhas 
are simply those who understand this truth. Thus it is often remarked in Zen 
literature that one’s “ordinary thoughts” or “everyday mind” is Enlightenment 
(satori). I quote a peculiarly suggestive passage from the Rinzai-roku: 


You must not be artful. Be your ordinary self. . . . You yourself as you 
are—that is Buddha Dharma. | stand or sit; I array myself or I eat; I 
sleep when I am fatigued. The ignoramus will deride me but the wise 
man will understand.° 


And further on the text states, 
Wherefore it is said that the everyday mind is the true law. 


Suzuki (1933) translates another passage from this text to the same effect; here 
Rinzai says: 


The truly religious man has nothing to do but go on with his life as he 
finds it in the various circumstances of this worldly existence. He rises 
quietly in the morning, puts on his dress and goes out to his work. 
When he wants to walk, he walks; when he wants to sit, he sits; He 
has no hankering after Buddhahood, not the remotest thought of it. 
How is this possible? A wise man of old days says, If you strive after 
Buddhahood by any conscious contrivances, your Buddha is indeed 
the source of eternal transmigration. (p. 260) 


This kind of writing is very easily misunderstood, for one would naturally 
ask, “If ordinary life is Nirvana and ordinary thoughts are Enlightenment, what- 
ever is Buddhism about, and what can it possibly teach us, other than to go on 
living exactly as we have lived before?” Before trying to answer this, we must 
quote two mondo, or Zen dialogues. The first is from the Mu-mon-kwan (xix): 


THE PROBLEM OF FAITH AND WORKS IN BUDDHISM 101 


Joshu asked Nansen, “What is the Tao?” “Usual life,” answered Nansen, 


29 66 


“is the very Tao.” “How can we accord with it?” “If you try to accord 


with it, you will get away from it.”” 


This looks very much like pure tariki psychology. Then Suzuki (1927) gives the 
following from Bokuju (Mu-chou): 


A monk asked him, “We have to dress and eat every day, and how 
can we escape from all that?” Bokuju replied, “We dress, we eat.” “I 


do not understand. 
eat your food.” (p. 12) 


If you don’t understand, put on your dress and 


Clearly the monk’s question involves much more than mere dressing and eating, 
which stands for life in Samsara as a whole—“the trivial round, the common task.” 

Applying philosophy to this more direct language, we find that the Zen 
teachers are demonstrating that Samsara, just as it is, is Nirvana, and that man, 
just as he is, is Buddha. Zen does not say so as a rule, because the terms, Nir- 
vana and Buddha, are concepts which do not move the soul deeply and lead 
easily to mere intellectualism. Zen wants us to feel nonduality, not just to think 
it, and therefore when we say, “Nirvana is Samsara,” we are joining two things 
together that were never in need of being joined. For both Zen and Shin aim, in 
different ways, to effect a psychological or spiritual state that moves the whole 
being, not the head alone. They are trying to set us free within ourselves, and 
to make us at home with ourselves and with the universe in which we live. 
This freedom is known when we give up “contriving” and accept ourselves 
as we are, but it does not seem to me that the experience can be effective 
unless there has first been a state of contriving and struggle. In Zen this is 
self-discipline; in Shin it is coming to an acute awareness of one’s insufficiency 
through a previous attempt at self-discipline. It is difficult to see how the Shin 
experience could be fully appreciated unless, like Shinran, one had first tried the 
jiriki way. The danger of continuing in the jiriki way is that one may so easily 
become a victim of spiritual pride, expecting to make oneself into a Buddha; 
the danger of the tariki way is that the experience may come so easily that its 
true meaning is unseen and its force unfelt. 

Spiritual freedom, however, involves much more than “go on living exactly 
as you have lived before.” It involves a particular kind of joyousness, or what 
the Buddhists term bliss (ananda). It is the discovery that to accord with the uni- 
verse, to express the Tao, one has but to live, and when this is fully understood 
it becomes possible to live one’s life with a peculiar zest and abandon. There 
are no longer any obstacles to thinking and feeling; you may let your mind go 
in whatever direction it pleases, for all possible directions are acceptable, and 
you can feel free to abandon yourself to any of them. Nowhere is there any 
possibility of escape from the principle of nonduality, for “you yourself as you 


102 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


are—that is Buddha Dharma.” In this state there can be no spiritual pride, for 
union or identity with the Buddha principle is not something achieved by man; 
it is achieved for him from the beginning of time, just as the sun has been set 
on high to give him light and life. 

Yet, in the life of the spirit, it is much harder to receive than to give; it is 
often such a blow to human pride to have to accept from Amida, God, or life 
what it would be so much more distinctive to achieve for oneself. In Shin terms, 
we should say that the meaning of freedom is that you can think any kind of 
thought, be any kind of person, and do any kind of thing without ever being 
able to depart from Amida’s all-embracing love and generosity. You are free to 
do as you like, and also as you don’t like, to be free and to be bound, to be a 
sage and to be a fool. Nowhere are there any obstructions to spiritual activity. 
At the same time, there is an intense awareness of the joy of that activity; one 
feels impelled to exercise it and feel the ecstasy of its abandon, much as we 
imagine a bird must feel high up in space, free to soar up, to swoop down, to 
fly north, south, east, or west, to circle, climb, tumble, or hover. For “the wind 
bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell 
whence it cometh nor whither it goeth. Even so is everyone that is born of the 
spirit.” Or, in the more matter-of-fact language of a Zen teacher, 


There are no by-roads, no cross-roads here. All year round the hills are 
fresh and green; east or west, in whichever direction, you may have a 
fine walk. (Yeh-hsien, as cited in Suzuki, 1934, p. 83) 


There remains the moral problem. To a superficial understanding the 
freedom of nonduality seems to be an invitation to libertinism of the most 
flagrant kind. In terms of philosophy, the Mahayana sutras state very frankly 
that the principle of nonduality is beyond good and evil, and that its attain- 
ment has no essential connection with morality. And morality here includes 
all kinds of works, both social and spiritual. Certainly the sutras speak of sila, 
or morality, as one of the necessary stages, but sometimes it seems as if sila 
were advocated simply as a safeguard against misuse of the enormous, amoral 
power of supreme knowledge. Thus the Lankavatara says: 


In ultimate reality there is neither gradation nor continuous succes- 
sion; [only] the truth of absolute solitude (viviktadharma) is taught 
here in which the discrimination of all the images is quieted. . . . But 
[from the absolute point of view] the tenth stage is the first, and the 
first is the eighth; and the ninth is the seventh, and the seventh is 
the eighth . . . what gradation is there where imagelessness prevails? 
(Suzuki, 1932, p. 186) 


In yet another passage we read, 


THE PROBLEM OF FAITH AND WORKS IN BUDDHISM _ 103 


Some day each and every one will be influenced by the wisdom and 
love of the Tathagatas of Transformation to lay up a stock of merit 
and ascend the stages. But, if they only realized it, they are already 
in the Tathagata’s Nirvana for, in Noble Wisdom, all things are in 
Nirvana from the beginning. (p. 186) 


An even stronger statement of the philosophy will be found in the Sapta- 
satikaprajnaparamita Sutra: 


O Sariputra, to commit the offences is to achieve the inconceivables, 
to achieve the inconceivables is to produce Reality. And Reality is non- 
dual. Those beings endowed with the inconceivables can go neither to 
the heavens, nor to the evil paths, nor to Nirvana. Those who commit 
the offences are not bound for the hells. Both the offences and the 
inconceivables are of Reality, and Reality is by nature non-dual. . . . In 
the real Dharmadhatu (realm of the Law) there is nothing good or bad, 
nothing high or low, nothing prior or posterior. . . . Bodhi (Enlight- 
enment) is the five offences and the five offences are Bodhi... . If 
there is one who regards Bodhi as something attainable, something in 
which discipline is possible, that one commits self-arrogance. (as cited 
in Suzuki, 1933, pp. 251-252) 


Here, besides an unequivocal statement of nonduality, there is again an example 
of tariki psychology, speaking of the arrogance of striving to attain Bodhi by 
discipline. 

Mahayana does not disguise the fact that its wisdom is dangerous and we 
know that monks of the jiriki schools are subjected to rigid disciplines just to 
pre-condition them against abuse of knowledge, which is unfortunately a fairly 
frequent occurrence. But it would seem that such abuse is only possible when 
the experience of freedom is feebly appreciated or improperly understood. Oddly 
enough, although the experience itself and the thing experienced (Tathata) is 
nondual and beyond good and evil, the result of a truly deep inexperience is 
morality. Shinran speaks very strongly against those who make use of Amida’s 
vow and then go on behaving as immorally as ever. He likens them to those 
who, because they have found an antidote to a poison, just go on taking it. 
But this is rather a negative way of looking at the problem. From the positive 
standpoint, Shin would say that Amida’s compassion for us and all other beings, 
when realized, calls out a corresponding compassion in ourselves. In terms of 
philosophic Mahayana we should say that, having understood that we and all 
creatures are Buddhas, we therefore treat them with the reverence due to the 
Buddha principle. 

A second factor that makes for morality is the gratitude felt for the freedom 
to be all of oneself, a gratitude so deep that men will often renounce some of 


104 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


that freedom as a thank-offering. Obviously there is more opportunity for this 
feeling of gratitude to grow when the ultimate Reality is personalized in the 
form of Amida. From the philosophic standpoint there is no real ground for 
gratitude, because in nonduality there is neither giver nor receiver. Hence the 
danger of a merely philosophic understanding. But from the emotional stand- 
point there appears to be every reason for gratitude. In discovering freedom 
to be all of oneself one has a similar experience to the Christian forgiveness 
of sins; however black your soul, it is not outside the love of God which is as 
omnipresent as God Himself, and in this connection it is worth citing a remark- 
able passage from the work of a Catholic theologian: 


For we are never really outside God nor He outside of us. He is 
more with us than we are with ourselves. The soul is less intimately 
with the body, than He is both in our bodies and souls. He as it were 
flows into us, or we are in Him as the fish in the sea. We use God, 
if we may dare to say so, whenever we make an act of our will, and 
when we proceed to execute a purpose. He has not merely given us 
clearness of head, tenderness of heart, and strength of limb, as gifts 
which we may use independently of Him when once He has conferred 
them upon us. But He distinctly permits and actually concurs with every 
use of them in thinking, loving or acting. This influx and concourse 
of God as theologians style it, ought to give us all our lives long 
the sensation of being in an awful sanctuary, where every sight and 
sound is one of worship. It gives a peculiar and terrific character to acts 
of sin... . Everything is penetrated with God, while His inexpressible 
purity is all untainted, and His adorable simplicity unmingled with that 
which He so intimately pervades, enlightens, animates and sustains. Our 
commonest actions, our lightest recreations, the freedoms in which we 
most unbend—all these things take place and are transacted, not so 
much on the earth and in the air, as in the bosom of the omnipresent 
God. (Faber, 1853, p. 65, italics added) 


There are important points in which Faber’s (1853) words diverge from 
Mahayana philosophy, for, in Christianity, God is essentially Other. But, in so far 
as doctrine is a symbol of our inner experience, I can see no important differ- 
ence between the inner feeling suggested by Faber’s words and the inner feeling 
of Mahayana Buddhism, especially in the Amidist cults. Thus the experience of 
freedom or Enlightenment is like discovering an immeasurably precious jewel in 
one’s littlest acts and lowest thoughts. One discovers it where all jewels are first 
found—in the depths of the earth, or lying in the mud. Those who appreciate 
jewels do not leave them there; they lift them up from the depths, polish them, 
place them on velvet or set them in gold. This polishing and adornment is our 
symbol of morality, the expression of our joy and gratitude in realizing that 


THE PROBLEM OF FAITH AND WORKS IN BUDDHISM | 105 


This very earth is the Lotus Land of Purity, 
And this very body is the body of Buddha.* 


It is here interesting to note that considerable importance is given to wor- 
ship in the Zen school which, philosophically, is the most iconoclastic form of 
Buddhism. Perhaps there is a clue to the apparent inconsistency of worship 
and nonduality in the following incident from the Hekigan-shu: 


Hwang-pa (Japanese, Obaku) stated, “I simply worship Buddha. I 
ask Buddha for nothing. I ask Dharma for nothing. I ask Sangha for 
nothing.” Someone then said, “You ask Buddha for nothing. You ask 
Dharma for nothing. You ask Sangha for nothing. What then, is the 
use of your worship?” At which remark, Hwang-pa gave him a slap 
on the face!’ 


The Buddhist feeling of worship and gratitude is most notably expressed, 
however, in the Bodhisattva-ideal, based on a profound intuition of the basic 
unity of all creatures and things. Those who, having attained Enlightenment, 
do not become Bodhisattvas, helpers of the world, are termed pratyeka-buddhas, 
which, in Mahayana philosophy, is almost a term of abuse. They are not will- 
ing to share their experience of freedom with their other selves, and, strictly 
speaking, Enlightenment is no Enlightenment unless it is shared and circulated. 
It is no one’s property, and those who try to possess it for themselves do not 
understand it. Service, morality, and gratitude are our response as men for a gift 
to which we cannot respond as Buddhas. The Buddha-principle is beyond morality, 
but not so the human principle. From the standpoint of nonduality, these two 
principles are one; yet what is so often overlooked in the study of Mahayana is 
that from the same standpoint they are two. For nonduality excludes nothing; 
it contains both unity and diversity, one and the many, identity and separation. 
Japanese Buddhism expresses this in the formula byodo soku shabetsu, shabetsu soku 
byodo—unity in diversity and diversity in unity. For this reason, philosophically, 
morally and spiritually, Buddhism is called the middle way.

CHAPTER SEVEN 


Zen (1948) 


INTRODUCTION 


here is nothing that men desire more than life—the fullness of 

life, Reality itself. In one form or another they try to possess it 
by every possible means, as happiness, as power, as joy, as wealth, as spiritual 
insight, and even as simple existence to which they cling with all their might 
for fear that it will be taken away. But one thing is certain: the harder you try 
to possess life, the faster it slips away from you, and the less you understand of 
its mystery. For life itself, whatever it may be, cannot be grasped in any form, 
whether of matter, of emotion, or of thought. The moment you try to hold it 
in a fixed form, you miss it. Water drawn from the stream is no longer living 
water, for it ceases to flow. This is what the Buddha meant in saying that the 
cause of all human misery was trishna or selfish craving, because trishna is the 
attempt to grasp life in some form, more especially in the form of one’s own 
personal existence. Man can only become alive in the fullest sense when he no 
longer tries to grasp life, when he releases his own life from the strangle-hold 
of possessiveness so that it can go free and be itself. 

In practice, almost all religions are attempts to grasp the mystery of life 
in either an intellectual formula or an emotional experience. Wherever it may 
be found, higher religion involves the discovery that this cannot be done, and 
that therefore man must relax his fearful grip upon life or God and permit it 
to possess him as, in fact, it does all the time whether he knows it or not. Zen 
Buddhism is a unique example of this kind of higher religion, and because the

word “Zen” (see figure 7.1) indicates this very spiritual state of full liveliness 
and nongrasping, it is really impossible to define Zen. Nevertheless, Zen has a 
philosophical and religious history by means of which we can arrive at some 
suggestion of its meaning. 

As a specific form of Buddhism, Zen is first found in China, being the pecu- 
liarly Chinese version of the kind of Buddhism which, according to tradition, 
was brought from India by the sage Bodhidharma (see figure 7.2) in or about 
the year A.D. 527. Bodhidharma’s Buddhism was a variety of the Mahayana 
School, the Buddhism of Northern India, which is to be distinguished from the 
Hinayana or Southern School of Buddhism now prevalent in Ceylon, Burma 
and Siam. The latter is founded on the Buddha’s teaching as preserved in the 
scriptures of the Pali language, whereas the former recognizes, in addition to 
these, certain Sanskrit scriptures of supposedly later date that are of a deeply 
metaphysical character. 

Bodhidharma’s variety of the Mahayana was known as Dhyana Buddhism, 
pronounced Ch’an in Chinese and Zen in Japanese, and though the nearest 
English equivalent of Dhyana is “contemplation” this term has acquired a static 
and even dreamy connotation quite foreign to Dhyana. Dhyana, Ch’an or Zen

nese (15th cent.).

means immediate insight into the nature of Reality or life. In China, Dhyana 
Buddhism was strongly influenced by Taoism and Confucianism, and, under 
the guidance of the practical mentality of the Chinese, emerged as the Zen we 
know today in the seventh century A.D. The development of this distinctively 
Chinese form of Dhyana was largely the work of Hui-neng (or Wei-lang), 
whose Tan-ching or Platform Sutra is one of its most authoritative texts. From 
713, when Hui-neng died, until the close of the thirteenth century, Zen flour- 
ished widely in China and exercised a profound effect on all branches of art 
and culture. Ei-sai brought it to Japan in 1191, where it may be found to this 
day in its most vital form and where, too, it has had an extremely far-reaching 
effect upon the national culture.’ 

In brief, Zen accounts for itself in the following way. Gautama Siddhartha 
became the Buddha, the Enlightened One, as the result of a profound spiri- 
tual experience, an immediate knowledge of Reality, which he realized while 
meditating under the famous Bodhi Tree near Gaya in Northern India. This 
knowledge, being ineffable, could never be put into words, and all the Bud- 
dha’s verbal teaching was simply an indication or suggestion of its nature, a 
mere device (upaya) for awakening men to real insight. The knowledge itself 
was, however, directly and mysteriously passed on to Mahakasyapa, the Bud- 
dha’s chief disciple, on an occasion when, instead of preaching a sermon, the 
Buddha silently held up a flower before his disciples. All stood nonplussed save 
Mahakasyapa, whose understanding smile brought this recognition from his 
master: “I have the most precious treasure, spiritual and transcendental, which 
this moment I hand over to you, O venerable Mahakasyapa!” Tradition asserts 
that this knowledge was handed down from Mahakasyapa through a line of 
patriarchs to Bodhidharma, who brought it to China, where it continued to be 
passed from teacher to teacher. Because this knowledge can never be written 
down Zen does not rely on scriptures, even though it may use them as devices. 
Words cannot convey it, just as they cannot describe colors to a blind man. 
Thus Zen is summed up as: 


A special transmission (of insight) outside the scriptures; 
No dependence upon words and letters; 

Direct pointing to the soul of man; 

Seeing into one’s own nature. 


To understand Zen adequately, however, we must realize that it is the fruit 
and synthesis of the most important trends in both Indian and Chinese religion. 


THE BACKGROUND IN INDIAN RELIGION 
Indian religion has ever been characterized by the quest for “that One thing, 


knowing which we shall know all.” In the Upanishads this “One thing” is termed 
Brahman, the absolute Reality of the universe beyond all opposites. All ordinary 


110 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


things and experiences have opposites; life is opposed to death, pleasure to pain, 
joy to sorrow, light to darkness. These opposites are necessary to one another, 
so that life is always limited by death, and joy by sorrow. But Reality itself has 
no opposite; it is advaita, nondual, and the soul of man is only delivered from 
death and sorrow by realizing its identity with Reality. For the Upanishads taught 
that Brahman is the true nature of ourselves and of all things. Not to realize 
this is ignorance (avidya) and unhappiness, but to know it is true knowledge 
(vidya) and a transcendental happiness which is eternal because, strange to say, 
it too has no opposite. Thus the religion of the Upanishads was more or less 
monistic, believing that all forms and objects were in fact manifestations of the 
One Absolute (see figure 7.3). 

Primitive Indian Buddhism also sought this Reality, but its way of approach 
was purely psychological. The Buddha felt that philosophical speculation about 
Reality was a waste of time and even a positive hindrance. Reality or Nirvana 
lay beyond all definition, and nothing was of importance but an immediate 
and intimate experience of it, and this could only be had by getting rid of 
trishna. Reality is here and now, but it is concealed by attempts to grasp it in 
this form or that. 

Later Indian Buddhism, which is to say Mahayana, linked both the psy- 
chological approach of primitive Buddhism and the metaphysical tradition of 
the Upanishads. But whereas the Upanishads described the nondual Reality as 
the One, Mahayana felt this term misleading. One is opposed to Many and 
None, for which reason Reality must transcend even oneness. Mahayana went 
beyond monism, and certainly beyond any trace of that Spinozist pantheism 
so often, and, it may be said, erroneously, attributed to the Upanishads. To say 
that all things are one is to reduce everything to something which is still short 
of nonduality, since, as we have seen, one-ness has an opposite and so cannot 
be the Absolute. Furthermore, the very statement, “All things are Reality,” con- 
tains an implied opposition between “all things” and “Reality.” In making such 
a statement we are uniting two things which are in no need of union. They 
are already united, and to try to create the union in thought or in feeling is to 


\t

both in Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism to denote ultimate Reality. 


ZEN 111 


imply to oneself that it does not already exist. Nirvana (the sense of Reality) 
IS Samsara (the state of ordinary life) and the very act of trying to realize 
that they are one implies that they are not. In any case, Reality is not one; it 
is nondual, having no opposite at all. 

Therefore Mahayana spoke of Reality as Tathata, or Thusness, and as Sun- 
yata, or the Void, considered not as mere emptiness but as “solid emptiness.” 
Sunyata resembles a crystal ball, which is visible to our eyes only because of 
what it reflects. Hold it up before a crowded street, and there within it is a 
crowded street. Hold it up before the empty sky, and there seems to be nothing 
in it, but only because it is reflecting the emptiness of the sky. Its true nature 
remains unknown. As the crystal ball reflects images, the manifold universe 
appears spontaneously within Sunyata. There is nothing in it, but everything 
comes out of it. Sunyata is the all-inclusive; having no opposite, there is noth- 
ing which it excludes or opposes. This was a philosophical theory expressing 
a spiritual and psychological state—the state of nongrasping or freedom from 
trishna. To thought and sense and feeling Reality is a void, for they cannot lay 
hold on it or keep it in any fixed form. But it is a living void, because all forms 
come out of it, and whoever realizes it is filled with life and power and the 
Bodhisattva’s love (karunay’ for all beings. 

From a somewhat more psychological standpoint, Sunyata is also regarded 
as the ground of human consciousness—the “essence of Mind,” the supra- 
individual Self, in which all our varying states of consciousness, our thoughts, 
emotions and sensations have their being, like images produced spontaneously 
in a mirror. This production of images is held to be playful rather than purpo- 
sive, as if in the act of “creation” Reality were simply enjoying itself—an idea 
resembling the Hindu view of the universe as the lila, the playful dance, of 
God. Thus Mahayana considers Reality under three aspects, which, somewhat 
in the manner of the Persons of the Christian Trinity, are in essence one: 
Dharmakaya, which is the pure and undifferentiated Sunyata, Sambhogakaya, 
which is the creative principle of enjoyment, the lila, and Nirmanakaya, which 
is the resultant manifested universe 


THE BACKGROUND IN CHINESE RELIGION 


While Zen derived its highly practical approach to religion from Confucian- 
ism, it was actually more deeply influenced by Taoism as taught by Lao-Tzu 
(sixth century B.C.) and Chuang-Tzu (third century B.C.). In Taoism Reality is 
termed Tao (see figure 7.4), another untranslatable word, which has, however, 
a rather more dynamic connotation than Brahman, Tathata or Sunyata. Tao 
is life considered as a flowing power, like the wind, or a stream, or the present 
moment. It is sometimes rendered as “the Way of things,” or as the Logos. A 
person who has realized union with Tao is said to be in a state of Te, or “grace,” 
while the method of realization is called Wu-wei (no-assertion), which is highly

similar to the Buddhist idea of giving up trishna. As in Buddhism, all evils are 
attributed to man’s self-assertiveness, his itch to possess life in fixed forms. But 
if he can realize that he is one with Tao, the fullness of life, he will cease to 
want to possess things and will therefore be free from evil. If man ceases from 
self-assertion and lets go of life, the Tao will have a chance to operate freely 
within him. His life will be lived not by his own ego, but by Tao. 

While Indian religion made its object the realization of man’s identity 
with Brahman or Tathata, of the inherent unity of appearance and Reality, 
Samsara and Nirvana, Chinese religion made its object harmony with the Tao. 
To Indian religion, the result of this realization was that man was delivered 
from the realm of opposites, that is, from life and death as we know them. His 
consciousness passed from the state of manifestation into the state of absolute 
Reality. Chinese religion was not in quite so much of a hurry to separate con- 
sciousness from everyday life. Man was in harmony with Tao here and now, 
fully in possession of his ordinary everyday consciousness of people and things. 
In principle, Mahayana Buddhism was at one with Taoism in this respect, for 
in insisting that there was no real difference between Nirvana and Samsara it 
could not allow the idea of passing from one to the other. Mahayana was, how- 
ever, somewhat infected with the characteristically Indian desire to escape from 
the world of form, but in China it lost this desire almost entirely. It became a 
world-transforming instead of a world-escaping religion. 

Despite superficial differences, it will be seen that these two trends of 
Indian and Chinese religion have a common essence. Hindu-Buddhist religion 
discovered the essential Reality of life through detachment from its particular 
forms, assisted by the practice of meditation. Taoism discovered the essential 
harmony of everyday life with Tao by letting go of that life so that it could 
be free to be itself. 

Both procedures are grounded in a common faith or trust, namely, that 
this everyday life IS Reality, that all things ARE in harmony with Tao, and that 
therefore this will be clear to you if you simply let go of the possessive itch. 
To try to attain union with Reality by action or by inaction (which is simply 
an indirect form of action) is to imply that you do not already have that union. 


ZEN 113 


There is nothing to be attained. The union simply IS; Samsara IS Nirvana. The 
effort to attain something is just another form of that acquisitive desire which 
springs from lack of trust in the one supreme fact. In the words of Hsi-yun: 


By their very seeking for it they produce the contrary effect of los- 
ing it, for that is using the Buddha to seek for the Buddha and using 
mind to grasp mind. Even though they do their utmost for a full kalpa 
(aeon), they will not be able to attain to it. . . . If it is held that there 
is something to be attained apart from mind and, thereupon, mind is 
used to seek it, (that implies) failure to understand that mind and the 
object of its search are one.’ (Chu, 1947, pp. 16, 24) 


THE MOMENTOUS HARMONY 


Historically, Zen is the embodiment of the common truth contained in the Hindu- 
Buddhist tradition and the Taoist tradition, the synthesis of the contemplative 
insight of Indian religion, the dynamic liveliness of Taoism, and the down-to- 
earthness of Confucianism. Zen is grounded precisely in this faith or trust that 
ordinary life is Tao, and is to be accepted or loved as such. The Zen master 
Chao-chu was asked, “What is the Tao?” He replied, “Everyday life is the Tao.” 
“How,” pursued the enquirer, “does one get into harmony with it?” “If you try 
to get into harmony with it, you will get away from it.” The attempt suggests 
the absence of the reality, and proceeds from lack of faith in the truth that har- 
mony already is. Lack of faith in this harmony creates the sense of inadequacy 
and insecurity which underlies all our aggressive and evil actions (see figure 7.5). 

But Zen is more than a synthesis of these various trends in Indian and Chi- 
nese religion. The unique contribution of Zen to higher religion is its method 
of presenting the truth, a method involving “No dependence on words and 
letters, and direct pointing to the soul of man’”—that is, to the Tao, Buddha- 
nature, or Reality itself.

114 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


It is all too easy for ideas and concepts to conceal rather than reveal Real- 
ity. Thus the Zen masters say that ideas are fingers pointing at the moon of 
Reality, but that most people mistake the finger for the moon. Furthermore, 
we have already seen that it is quite impossible for ideas to describe or convey 
the deepest truth of life, since ideas are forms and Reality is too living to be 
held in any form. Zen, therefore, does not consist in acquiring new ideas about 
Reality and our relation to it; it consists in getting rid of ideas and feelings about 
life in order that we may get to life itself. The statement that ordinary life is 
Tao, or that we are one with Reality just as we are, here and now, is still an 
idea, and while it remains an idea it is still an attempt to capture the living 
truth in a fixed formula. Really to understand Zen we have to get away from 
this abstract and dead realm of concepts and come face-to-face with Reality as 
it stands quite clearly before us here and now. 

There is only one place where we are truly alive, where we come into 
immediate contact with Reality, and that is now—this present moment. The 
past was only real when it was the present moment, and the future will only 
be real when it becomes it. The past continues to be real to the extent that it 
lives on effectually in the present. But real life is always now. In fact, we have 
no knowledge of any other reality than the present moment, and, strictly 
speaking, nothing has any existence save at this moment. Yet what we call 
the present moment is strangely elusive. As soon as we try to catch hold of 
it, it seems to run away. We cannot delay or hold it in any of the forms that 
it assumes or contains. We have moments of pleasure and moments of pain, 
but when we try to grab hold of the moment of pleasure, the moment, the 
movement, the life leaves the pleasure and it turns to dust in our hands. So, 
too, when we try to examine the moment, we cannot discover it, for it is too 
small to see. The more we look for it, the tinier it becomes, until we realize 
that it is infinitesimal and thus infinite. 

Yet however much we may try to delay or grasp the moment, the fact 
remains that while, from one point of view, it eludes us, from another, we 
cannot get away from it. We may try to lag behind in the past or to hurry on 
into the future, but inevitably we do our lagging or hurrying in the present 
moment. As soon as we realize that the moment is in reality inescapable, we 
shall no longer try to grasp it; for whether we know it or not, it grasps us. 
For the now, this present moment, is Reality. All things proceed from it and 
exist in it, and yet when we look at it directly it seems nothing. Now is Tao, 
and Tao is now, and even though we do our damnedest to possess it, we are 
still unable to get out of it. Our union with Reality is the truth whether we 
realize it or not, whether we strive to attain it or not. 

But to say that the now is Tao, or is Reality, at once introduces a concept, 
which, useful though it may be for a time, instantly distracts our attention 
from the real now. At once our religion becomes dead and removed from life, 
for although this now, this eternal moment, looks so void and so uninteresting 


ZEN 115 


to sense and thought, in fact it is the mysterious source of all liveliness and 
power. The genius of Zen lies in its way of pointing to the real now without 
distracting the attention with concepts. But the human mind, because of its 
inherently possessive nature, lets go of concepts with extreme reluctance, for 
which reason Zen has sometimes to attack and smash them quite violently. 
Thus its technique has often the appearance of spiritual shock-tactics. 


DIRECT POINTING 


The Zen way of teaching is to demonstrate Reality rather than to talk about 
it, or, if words are used at all, to avoid formally religious terminology and 
conceptual statements. When Zen speaks it expresses Reality, not with logical 
explanations and doctrines but with everyday conversation, or with statements 
that upset the normal conceptual mode of thinking so violently that they 
appear as utter nonsense. Because Zen desires to get rid of concepts, to shatter 
the rigid frames in which we try to possess life, it employs a thorough-going 
iconoclasm (see figure 7.6). At the same time, Zen as a formal religious cult 
reads the scriptures, uses images and ceremonies, and sometimes breaks down 
far enough to include sermons and explanations. But it is just the preservation 
of this formal aspect of religion that makes the informal and iconoclastic such 
a puzzling and effective contrast, a truth that Western reformers and iconoclasts 
have never appreciated. 

The greater part of Zen literature consists of mondo, of brief dialogues 
between masters and pupils, which illustrate its peculiar method of instruction, 
pointing to the real now without interposing ideas and notions about it. Here, 
for example, is the way in which Zen deals with the problem of nonduality, 
concerning which Indian Buddhism has composed so many volumes of intri- 
cate explanation:

ite subject of Zen painters. A verse that describes Zen life says: “The bamboo 
shadows are sweeping the stairs, but no dust is stirred.” 


116 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


A monk asked Dosan, “How do we escape the heat when summer comes 
and the cold when winter is here?” 

The master said, “Why not go where there is no summer, no winter?” 

“Where is such a place?” 

“When the cold season comes, one is thoroughly chilled; when the hot 
summer is here, one swelters.” 

As to escaping from Samsara, the world of opposites and everyday conscious- 
ness, to Nirvana, the realm of absolute unity and peace, Zen has this to say: 

Bokuju was once asked, “We have to dress and eat every day, and how 
can we escape from all that?” 

The master replied, “We dress, we eat.” 

“IT don’t understand.” 

“If you do not understand, put on your dress and eat your food.” 

Or again: 

“Pray show me the way to deliverance.” 

“Who has ever put you in bondage?” 

“Nobody.” 

“If so, why should you ask for deliverance?” 

Another master deals with this question rather more explicitly, but we must 
be careful that he does not fool us: 

Hui-hai was asked, “How can one attain the Great Nirvana?” 

“Have no karma that works for transmigration.”* 

“What is the karma of transmigration?” 

“To seek after the Great Nirvana, to abandon the defiled and take to the 
undefiled, to assert that there is something attainable and something realizable, 
not to be free from the teaching of opposites—this is the karma that works 
for transmigration.” 

“How can one be emancipated?” 

“No bondage from the very first, and what is the use of seeking eman- 
cipation? Act as you will, go on as you feel—without second thought. This is 
the incomparable way.” 

Hui-hai’s final remark must not, however, give the impression that Zen is 
just living lazily and fatuously in the present and taking life as it comes. If this 
be used as a formula for grasping the reality of Zen, the whole point is missed. 
A master was asked, “What is the Tao?” “Walk on!” he shouted. Thus whenever 
you think you have the right idea of Zen, drop it and walk on. 

More and more we shall see that the essence of Zen is simply the giving 
up of any attempt to grasp life in ideational or emotional forms. It involves 
a thoroughgoing acceptance of life and experience just as it is at any given 
moment, which, whether we know it or not, is precisely what our basic, mirror- 
like consciousness is doing all the time. Passion, anger, elation, depression, ideas 
of good and evil, mine and yours—these are varying forms taken by our feel- 
ings and thoughts, whereas the essence of Mind, the essential consciousness, is 


ZEN 117 


ever formless, free and pure. “The perfect man,” said Chuang-Tzu, “employs his 
mind as a mirror; it grasps nothing, it refuses nothing, it receives, but does not 
keep.” At the same time, this must not lead us to form the concept of a pure 
and unchanging consciousness separate and apart from the changing forms of 
thoughts and things. The point is not at all to reject phenomena and cling to 
the Absolute, because the very nature of the Absolute, of the essential Mind, is 
nonclinging. As soon as we conceive a formless Self or mind-essence underlying 
and distinct from the changing contents of experience, we are denying the very 
nature of that Self. For its nature is not to separate itself from anything, not 
to stand apart from experience but to accept and identify itself with it. Its very 
life and power consist in a perpetual self-abandonment to its varied experiences, 
an identification of itself with its changing forms, which in Christian language 
would be called the divine love. Nor must it be thought that we have to make 
the pure Mind perform this act of self-abandonment; it does it by itself all the 
time, in us and through us, whether we wish it or not. 

This, then, is why Hui-neng constantly insisted that the only difference 
between an ordinary man and a Buddha, an enlightened one, is that the lat- 
ter knows he is a Buddha whereas the former does not. When asked, “What 
is enlightenment?” a master replied, “Your everyday mind.” “When a thought 
moves,” wrote Kaku-an, “another follows, and then another—an endless train of 
thoughts is thus awakened. Through enlightenment all this turns into truth.” In 
reality the enlightened consciousness is not different from our ordinary everyday 
consciousness; to seek it as something over and above our mind as it is at this 
moment is immediately to set up a dualism. We thrust realization from us in 
the very act of regarding it as something to be attained. This seeming paradox 
is aptly expressed by Ma-tsu: 


In the Tao there is nothing to discipline oneself in. If there is any 
discipline in it, the completion of such discipline means the destruc- 
tion of the Tao. But if there is no discipline whatever in the Tao, one 
remains an ignoramus. 


It is only through seeking enlightenment that we find there is no need to seek. 
He goes on: 


One thought follows another without interruption; the preceding one 
does not wait for the succeeding; each one is self-contained and quies- 
cent. This is called the “Meditation of the Ocean-stamp,” in which are 
included all things, like the ocean where all the rivers however different 
in size empty themselves. (Suzuki, 1935, pp. 126-127) 


Whether we know it or not, the “ocean” of pure consciousness perfectly 
accepts the stream of our thoughts and impressions all the time. At every 


118 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


instant we are in complete harmony with the Tao, but an apparent discord 
arises when, through a wrong use of memory and anticipation, we allow past 
and future experiences to conflict with the present. In the words of Emerson: 


These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or 
to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God today. 
There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in 
every moment of its existence . . . But man postpones or remembers; 
he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the 
past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to 
foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives 
with nature in the present, above time.’ 


But between the unconscious harmony of the rose and the conscious 
harmony of the perfect man lies the illusion of self-consciousness, separation 
and discord, wherein we strive blindly for what in truth we have never lost. 
Yet this itself is no more an actual loss of the Tao than the disappearance of 
the rose in winter is a violation of its natural and proper life. The bloom is 
forgotten and the seed goes underground. “Unless a grain of corn falls into 
the earth and dies,” said Jesus, “it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much 
fruit.” In spiritual development there must always be the middle stage wherein 
by apparent loss, by seeking and striving, we become conscious of the harmony 
that is our unconscious possession all long. 


Before a man studies Zen, to him mountains are mountains and waters 
are waters; after he gets an insight into the truth of Zen through 
instruction of a good master, mountains to him are not mountains 
and waters are not waters; but after this when he really attains to the 
abode of rest, mountains are once more mountains and waters are 
waters. (Ch’ing-yuan, as cited in Suzuki, 1927, p. 12) 


The ignoramus, the primitive “simple” man, accepts life for what it is, just 
as it comes. The “seeker,” however, looks for the God, the Reality, the absolute 
and eternal consciousness behind life, regarding the images of ordinary experi- 
ence as a distracting illusion. But the perfect man, consciously one with the 
Tao, again accepts life for just for what it is. 

T’an asked a student, “What were you before you became a monk?” 

“I used to be a cowherd.” 

“How do you look after the cattle?” 

“I go out with them early in the morning and come home when it grows 
dark.” 

“Splendid is your ignorance!” 


ZEN 119 


Zen is spiritual freedom or spiritual poverty, that is, the liberation of our 
true nature (Buddha-nature or essence of Mind) from the burden of those fixed 
ideas and feelings about Reality which we accumulate through fear—the fear 
that life will run away from us. “Scholars,” said Lao-Tzu, “gain every day; but 
Taoists lose every day.” Or in the words of Jesus, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. . . . Blessed are the pure (ie., naked and 
free) in heart, for they shall see God.” Such poverty and freedom are expressed 
in this poem from the Mumon-kan:° 


Hundreds of spring-flowers; the autumn moon; 
A fresh summer breeze; winter snow: 

Free your mind from idle thoughts, 

And for you any season is a good season. 


But again, we must “walk on” even from spiritual poverty if this be used as a 
means to grasp the truth of Zen. Chao-chu was asked, “What would you say 
to one who comes to you with nothing?” “Throw it away!” 

These mondo may seem puzzling to the uninitiated, but in fact there is noth- 
ing obscure or hidden about them. The truth which they indicate is, however, 
of such radical simplicity and self-evidence that our complex and burdened 
minds find it hard to see. 


It is so clear that it takes long to see. 

You must know that the fire which you are seeking 

Is the fire in your own lantern, 

And that your rice has been cooked from the very beginning.’ 


Or, as Pai-chang said when asked how to find Reality, “It is very much like 
looking for an ox when you are riding on one.” 

Kozankoku, a Confucian, came to Kwaido to ask about the hidden teach- 
ing of Zen. Kwaido said, “There is a passage in the text you are so thoroughly 
familiar with, which fitly describes the teaching of Zen. Did not Confucius 
declare, ‘Do you think I am holding something back from you, O my disciples? 
Indeed, I have held nothing back from you.’” 

Kozankoku could not understand this, and vainly pressed the master for a 
further explanation. But later, when they were walking together in the moun- 
tains, they passed a bush of wild laurel. 

“Do you smell it?” asked Kwaido. 

“Yes,” 

“There, I have kept nothing back from you!” 

It would be fatal, however, to interpret this in a sentimentally pantheistic 
sense, as if Kwaido were saying that the smell of the wild laurel is the Tao. 


120 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


No such conceptualism enters here. Pantheism, deism, theism, monism, dual- 
ism—all these are intellectual forms that must fail to grasp the living Reality. 
But when this has been thoroughly understood, intellectual forms may be used 
again without captivating the mind. 

Strictly speaking, Zen does not have a method for awakening our minds to 
Reality, unless it may be called a “method of no-method.” A method, a technique 
for discovering Reality implies an attempt to grasp it, and this, according to 
Zen, is as misleading and unnecessary as “putting legs on a snake” or “adding 
frost over snow.” In the words of Lin-chi: 


The true man who has an insight into Reality .. . gives himself up 
to all manners of situations in which he finds himself in obedience to 
his past karma. He appears in whatever garments are ready for him 
to put on. As it is desired of him either to move or to sit quietly, he 
moves or sits. He has not a thought of running after Buddhahood. He 
is free from such pinings. Why is it so with him? Says an ancient sage, 
“When the Buddha is sought after, he is the cause of transmigration.” 
(Suzuki, 1934a, pp. 32-33). 


ZEN MEDITATION 


While, from one point of view, Zen has no method, from another it has a definite 
technique of meditation. It is against this background of definite technique that 
the “method of no-method” has its value as a surprising contrast. The success 
of Zen lies in its freedom both to use technique and to dispense with it; it is 
not bound to any one-sided procedure. The Zen way of meditation, known as 
za-zen, is the result of a long process of development. 

Zen has always been a semi-monastic religion, though Zen monks do 
not take life vows, because many of them remain in the monastery only for 
a period of training before going back into the world as secular priests or lay- 
men. In some ways these institutions resemble our theological seminaries rather 
than monasteries in the strict sense. Originally Zen “monasteries” were small 
groups of monks gathered around an approved roshi or master, whose way of 
handling them was relatively informal and spontaneous. The early mondo are 
simply records of the daily life and teaching of these primitive communities. 
Before long, however, these mondo were collected and some of them were used 
as formal koan, or subjects for meditation. Monks devoted part of their time 
to meditation, and part to manual work in support of the community, a way 
of life somewhat like the rule of St. Benedict. 

In meditation the monk sits cross-legged in the “lotus-posture” (padmasana), 
and by slow, rhythmic breathing brings his mind to a state of calm and freedom 
from ideas. He then takes up his koan and drops it into his mind like a stone 
into a still pool, whereafter he simply watches its effect. Some of the famous 


ZEN 121 


koan are these: “Before father and mother, what is your true nature?” or, as we 
might word it, “Beyond time and space, what is Reality?” “What is the sound 
of your hand?” “Stop the booming of the distant bell’”—how can this be done? 
“When asked, “What is Buddha?’ Ummon answered, ‘Dried dung!’ ”—what does 
this mean?’ Sometimes the koan seem to contradict each other. When asked, 
“What is Buddha?” Ba-so answered, “This mind is Buddha,” but on another 
occasion he said, “This mind is not Buddha.” 

At regular intervals the monk goes to the roshi for an interview (sanzen) 
when he is expected to demonstrate his view of the koan assigned to him. This 
is not to be done by wordy explanation, but by some kind of direct action or 
direct pointing to Reality in the true Zen style. The roshi responds in the same 
way, sometimes with a laconic comment, sometimes with silence, sometimes 
with a bang on the head from the big stick which lies before him—for all these 
measures are parts of his spiritual shock-tactics. Usually the monk sees into the 
meaning of his koan suddenly, experiencing a flash of insight termed satori, and 
this may occur during meditation, during sanzen, or while he is going about his 
ordinary work. For we see into Reality suddenly just because there is no real 
method or succession of stages for approaching it (see figure 7.7). 

There are some 1,700 koan, and approximately 50 are needed for a full Zen 
training. It would seem that the various types of koan are used for getting rid 
of different types of conceptualism and mental fixation, and thus for revealing 
different “aspects” of the full understanding of Zen. More advanced koan have 
to do with the way in which Reality manifests itself in life and action. But it 
is almost impossible to discuss this subject with profit, since experiment alone 
can make sense of it. In the course of centuries koan meditation has become 
an art of the deepest subtlety, though much may be learned from the general 
attitude of Zen quite apart from work with za-zen.

“no-mind.” This is a special term for the Zen consciousness that is impossible 
to render in any one English phrase. It might be said that the whole art of 
Zen is in learning to understand the difference between wu hsin and mere 
empty-mindedness or unconsciousness. Wu hsin is the psychological equivalent 
of Sunyata, the “solid” or creative void that effortlessly produces and embraces 
the universe. 


122 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


THE CULTURAL EFFECTS OF ZEN 


Zen has entered into many aspects of the life of the Far East—painting, archi- 
tecture, gardening, chivalry, tea-ceremony, etiquette, poetry and ethics. Zen 
affects every sphere of daily life from the statecraft of the ruler to the menial 
work of the labourer. As a Zen poet says: 


How wondrous, how miraculous, this— 
I draw water and I carry fuel! 


Its moral effects are profound but not obvious, for the oriental idea of 
goodness is not so self-conscious and self-assertive as the occidental. As Lao- 
Tzu said, the wise man hides his virtue and appears on the surface like a fool, 
for “true grace (Te) does not appear as grace, and thus is grace; false grace 
is so aware of itself as grace that it is not grace.” Zen produces thousands of 
Bodhisattvas who do not advertise themselves (see figure 7.8). 

The most obvious effects of Zen are in the realm of aesthetics, for Chinese 
art of the T’ang, Sung and Yuan periods, the Japanese painting of Sesshu and 
the Sumiye school, the gardening art of Kobori Enshiu, the haiku poetry of 
Basho and others—all these have had direct inspiration from Zen, or from a 
Zen-flavored Taoism. Three major characteristics of Far Eastern art exemplify 
aspects of the Zen life: 

1. Absence of symmetry. The phenomena of nature are rarely symmetrical 
in form; at most there is only an approximation to absolute symmetry, and Zen 
perceives in this fact the lively and dynamic quality of nature. For symmetry is 
a state of such perfect balance that movement is no longer possible; a form so 
balanced is dead, and thus the symmetrical form is analogous to that mental 
and emotional fixation, which in Zen is ever broken down. It is for this reason 
that Chinese and Japanese paintings are so seldom architectural and wooden. 
There is no feeling at all of stuffing and the glass case in their drawings of birds, 
and the very rocks and mountains seem to flow. As a Western poet has said: 


A

Ua

Patriarch. Based on the painting by Liang K’ai, Chinese (13th cent.). 


ZEN 123 


The hills are shadows, and they flow 
From form to form, and nothing stands. 


2. The use of emptiness. As Zen perceives the forms of life within Sunyata, 
the all-inclusive mystery of the Void, Chinese painting makes the greatest use 
of the empty background, of large expanses of mist, to suggest depth. For the 
empty spaces of Chinese painting are no mere emptiness; they are creative and 
suggestive, exciting the imagination and giving a startling clarity and vividness 
to the objects drawn against and within them. Zen taste deplores the cluttering 
of a picture or of a room with many objects. It likes to take an empty space, 
and, within it, concentrate attention on one point—like the koan thrown into 
the still pool of the mind, like the one point of the living moment within the 
emptiness of past and future. 

3. The instantaneous quality. This might be called, too, the momentary 
quality, for Chinese and Japanese art love to portray moments of life, as if the 
painter had just glimpsed his subject for a second. A duck is painted just in 
the act of alighting, or a spray of bamboos caught in a sudden gust of wind. 
The very media of the art—brush, ink and silk or absorbent paper—require a 
swift, evenly flowing technique. As in life itself, a stroke once made can never 
be retouched. Zen, as Suzuki (1936) points out, 


permits no ossification as it were of each moment. It takes hold of 
each moment as it is born from Sunyata, that is, Emptiness, accord- 
ing to Buddhist philosophy. Momentariness is therefore characteristic 
of this philosophy. Each moment is absolute, alive, and significant. 
The frog leaps, the cricket sings . . . a breeze passes through the pine 
branches . . . Buddhism is quick to catch each movement of nature 
and expresses its impressions in a seventeen syllable poem or in a few 
strokes of the brush. (p. 26) 


CONCLUSION 


The occidental reader must not gather from the foregoing that Zen is an easy- 
going aestheticism, a philosophy of idling along with the stream of events. Zen 
has also been the religion of warriors who applied it on the battlefield in the 
very moment of danger: 


Under the sword raised high 
Is hell, making you tremble. 
But walk on!— 

And there is the Land of Bliss. 


The momentariness of Zen lies above and beyond the two wrong extremes of 
idling and hurrying, in an amazing poise, not of rigidity, but of balance in motion,

of the Void (Sunyata) is written: “Not one thing inside.” 


not of the statue but of the dancer. For this is the balance of living Reality itself, 
of the unmoved Mover, of the whirlwind with peace at the heart (see figure 7.9). 

In essence, Zen involves no doctrine. It is an experience of Reality beyond 
doctrine, for which reason Zen may be of use to people of any religion. It is 
to be doubted, however, whether one can ground one’s life in pure, essential 
Zen alone, for even as a specific religious cult Zen employs forms and sym- 
bols, and the normal structure of the Buddhist religion. For pure life expresses 
itself within and through structure. Life without structure is unseen; it is the 
unmanifested Absolute. But structure without life is dead, and religion has 
altogether too much of this death. 

For the ordinary religious consciousness grasps too much, and has too little 
faith in the actual present fact of the Life of life as the most all-absorbing and 
self-evident reality of our existence. 


Like unto space it knows no boundaries; 

Yet it is right here with us, ever retaining its serenity and fullness; 

It is only when you seek it that you lose it. 

You cannot take hold of it, nor can you get rid of it; 

While you can do neither, it goes on its own way; 

You remain silent and it speaks; you speak and it is silent; 

The great gate of charity is wide open with no obstructions whatever 
before it. 

(Hsuan-chiao, Cheng-tao Ke, 34, as cited in Suzuki, 1935, p. 115) 


NOTES 


1. A somewhat different account of the history of Zen in China is given by Hu Shih 
(1932). He traces its origins back to Tao-seng (d. 434), a disciple of a school of Taoist 
interpreters of Yoga represented by Hui-yuan (d. 416) and Tao-an (d. 385). According to 
Hu Shih, Bodhidharma arrived in Canton as early as 470, but, even so, found Tao-seng’s 


ZEN 125 


Dhyana school already in existence. The account given above follows Suzuki (1927), 
but at present there is insufficient material at hand to enable the occidental student to 
decide between Suzuki and Hu Shih. Suzuki’s account follows the official version of 
the Zen school. 


2. Karuna is the moral equivalent of all-inclusiveness. 


3. The term “mind” as used here signifies that ground of consciousness or mind- 
essence which, as explained above, is identical with Sunyata. 


4. Karma (literally, action) is the law of causality, and thus the phrase “karma that 
works for transmigration” means the kind of action which has the effect of binding the 
agent to Samsara, where, according to general Buddhist belief, man is born again and 
again into the world until he realizes Nirvana.

The Way of Liberation in Zen Buddhism (1955)* 


ords can express no more than a tiny fragment of human 

knowledge, for what we can say and think is always immea- 
surably less than what we experience. This is not only because there are no 
limits to the exhaustive description of an event, as there are no limits to the 
possible divisions of an inch; it is also because there are experiences that defy 
the very structure of our language, as water cannot be carried in a sieve. But 
the intellectual, the man who has a great skill with words, is always in danger 
of restricting what can be known to what can be described. He is therefore 
apt to be puzzled and suspicious when anyone tries to use ordinary language 
to convey an experience which shatters its logic, an experience that words can 
express only at the cost of losing their meaning. He is suspicious of fuzzy and 
ill-conceived thinking, and concludes that there is no experience that can cor- 
respond to such apparently nonsensical forms of words. 

This is particularly true of an idea that crops up repeatedly in the his- 
tory of philosophy and religion—the idea that the seeming multiplicity of 
facts, things, and events is in reality One, or, more correctly, beyond duality. 
This idea is usually intended to convey more than a speculative theory; it is 
intended to convey the actual experience of unity, which may also be described 
as the sense that everything that happens or can happen is right and natural 
in so positive a way that it can even be called divine. To put it in the words 
of the Shinjinmei:

128 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


One is all; 

All is one. 

If only it can be thus, 

Why trouble about being imperfect?! 


To the logician such an utterance is meaningless, and to the moralist it is 
plainly subversive. Even the psychologist may wonder whether there can be a 
state of mind or feeling that such words can faithfully represent. For he may 
insist that sensations or feelings are recognizable only by their mutual differ- 
ences, as we know white by contrast with black, and that therefore a sensation 
of nondifference, of absolute oneness, could never be realized. At most it would 
be like putting on rose-tinted spectacles. One would at first be aware of rosy 
clouds by contrast with the memory of white clouds, but in time the contrast 
would fade, and the all-pervasive hue would vanish from consciousness. Yet the 
literature of Zen Buddhism does not suggest that the experience of unity or 
nonduality is recognized only temporarily, by contrast with the former experi- 
ence of multiplicity. It suggests that it is an abiding experience that by no means 
fades with familiarity. Our best way of understanding it will be to follow, as 
best we can, the inner process through which the experience is realized. This 
will mean, in the first place, treating it from the psychological point of view, 
to find out whether the words express any psychological reality, let alone any 
logical sense or moral propriety. 

It may be assumed that the starting-point is the ordinary man’s feeling of 
conflict between himself and his environment, between his desires and the hard 
facts of nature, between his own will and the jarring wills of other people. 
The ordinary man’s desire to replace this sense of conflict by a sense of har- 
mony has its parallel in the age-old concern of philosophers and scientists to 
understand nature in terms of unity—in the human mind’s perennial discontent 
with dualism. We shall see that this is in many ways a rather unsatisfactory 
starting-point. The problem of telling anyone how to proceed from this point 
to the experience of unity reminds one of the yokel who was asked the way 
to an obscure village. He scratched his head for a while and then answered, 
“Well, sir, | know where it is, but if I were you I wouldn't start from here.” 
But unfortunately this is just where we are. 

Let us, then, consider some of the ways in which the Zen masters have 
handled this problem. There are four ways in particular which seem to deserve 
special attention, and these may be listed briefly as follows: 

1. To answer that all things are in reality One. 

2. To answer that all things are in reality Nothing, Void. 

3. To answer that all things are perfectly all right and natural just as they are. 

4. To say that the answer is the question, or the questioner. 

The question itself may assume many different forms, but essentially it is the 
problem of liberation from conflict, from dualism, from what Buddhism calls 
the samsara or vicious circle of birth-and-death. 


THE WAY OF LIBERATION IN ZEN BUDDHISM 129 


1. As an example of the first type of answer, the assertion that all things 
are in reality One, consider the words of Eka: 


The profound truth is the principle of ultimate identity. 

Under delusion the mani gem may be called a broken tile, 

But when you enter truly into self-awakening it is a real pearl. 

Ignorance and wisdom are alike without difference, 

For you should know that the ten thousand things are all Suchness 
(tathata). 

It is out of pity for those disciples who hold a dualistic view 

That I put words in writing and send this letter. 

Regarding this body and the Buddha as neither differing nor separate, 

Why, then, should we seek for something which does not need to be 
added to us?” 


The implication of this answer is that liberation from the conflict of dual- 
ism does not require any effort to change anything. One has only to realize that 
every experience is identical with the One, the Buddha-nature, or the Tao, and 
then the problem will simply vanish. Similarly, when Joshu asked Nansen, “What 
is the Tao?” Nansen replied, “Your ordinary mind is the Tao.” “How,” asked 
Joshu, “can one return into accord with it?” Nansen answered, “By intending 
to accord you immediately deviate.” 

The psychological response to answers of this kind will be an attempt to 
feel that every experience, every thought, sensation, or feeling is the Tao—that 
somehow the good is the same as the bad, the pleasant the same as the pain- 
ful. This may take the form of trying to attach the symbol-thought “this is the 
Tao” to each experience as it arises, though obviously it will be hard to realize 
much content, much meaning, in a symbol which applies equally to every pos- 
sible experience. Yet as the frustration of not realizing any content arises, it is 
asserted that this, too, is the Tao—so that any grasp of what the nature of this 
One that is All may be becomes more and more elusive. 

2. Thus another, and perhaps better, way of answering the original question 
is to assert that all things are in reality No-thing or Void (sunyata), following 
the doctrine of the Prajnaparamita-hrdaya Sutra, “Form is precisely the void; 
the void is precisely form.”* This answer provokes no attempt to find content 
or meaning in the term used to represent the One reality. In Buddhism the 
word sunya or Void implies inconceivability rather than mere nothingness. The 
psychological response to the assertion that all is One might be described as an 
attempt to say “Yes” to every experience as it arises, as an attempt to achieve 
a total acceptance or affirmation of life in all its aspects. Contrariwise, the 
psychological response suggested by the assertion that all is Void would be an 
attempt to say “No” to each experience. 

This is found also in the Vedanta, where the formula neti-neti, “no, no,” 
is used to support the understanding that no experience is the One reality. In 


130 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


Zen, the word mu’—no, not, or nothing—is used in a similar way, and is often 
employed as a koan’ or initiatory problem in meditation for beginners in such a 
way that at all times and under all circumstances one persists in saying the word 
“No” to everything that happens—including saying the word “No.” Hence the 
reply of Joshu to the question, “How will it be when I come to you without 
a single thing?” “Throw it down!”’ 

3. Then there are the answers which seem to imply that nothing has to 
be done at all, neither saying “Yes” to everything nor “No” to everything. The 
point here is rather to leave one’s experience and one’s own mind alone and 
allow them to be just as they are. Consider the following from Rinzai: 


One can only resolve past karma as the circumstances arise. When it’s 
time to dress, put your clothes on. When you have to walk, then walk. 
When you have to sit, then sit. Don’t have a single thought in your 
mind about seeking for Buddhahood. How can this be? The ancients 
say, “If you desire deliberately to seek the Buddha, your Buddha is just 
Samsara.” . . . Followers of the Tao, there is no place in Buddhism for 
using effort. Just be ordinary, without anything special. Relieve your 
bowels, pass water, put on your clothes, and eat your food. When 
you're tired, go and lie down. Ignorant people may laugh at me, but 
the wise will understand. . . . The ancients say, “To happen to meet a 
man of Tao upon the road, you must first not be facing the Tao.” Thus 
it is said that if a person practices the Tao, the Tao will not work.* 


Similarly, a monk asked Bokuju, “We dress and eat every day, and how do 
we escape from having to put on clothes and eat food?” The master answered, 


2&6 20 «6 


“We dress, we eat.” “I don’t understand.” “If you don’t understand,” said the 
master, “put on your clothes and eat your food.” In other incidents the state 
of nonduality is sometimes represented as beyond the opposites of “heat” and 


“cold,” but when asked to describe this state Zen will say: 


When cold, we gather round the hearth before the blazing fire; 
When hot, we sit on the bank of the mountain stream in the bamboo 
grove.’° 


The psychological response here seems to be one of letting one’s mind 
respond to circumstances as it feels inclined, not to quarrel with feeling hot in 
summer or cold in winter, and—it must also be added—not to quarrel with 
the feeling that there is some feeling you want to quarrel with! It is as if to say 
that the way you are actually feeling is the right way to feel, and that the basic 
conflict with life and oneself arises from trying to change or get rid of one’s 
present feeling. Yet this very desire to feel differently may also be the present 
feeling that is not to be changed. 


THE WAY OF LIBERATION IN ZEN BUDDHISM 131 


4. There is finally the fourth type of answer that turns the question back 
on itself, or on the questioner himself. Eka asked Bodhidharma, “I have no 
peace of mind. Please pacify my mind.” Bodhidharma replied, “Bring out your 
mind here before me, and I will pacify it!” “But when I seek my own mind,” 
said Eka, “I cannot find it.” “There!” concluded Bodhidharma, “I have pacified 
your mind!” 

Doshin asked Sosan, “What is the method of liberation?” The master 
replied, “Who binds you?” “No one binds me.” “Why then,” said the master, 
“should you seek liberation?’ There are other instances where the answer is 
simply the repetition of the question, or some such reply as “Your question is 
perfectly clear. Why ask me?” 

Replies of this type seem to throw attention back upon the state of mind 
from which the question arises, as if to say, “If your feelings are troubling you, 
find out who or what it is that is being troubled.” The psychological response is 
therefore to try to feel what feels and to know what knows—to make an object 
of the subject. Yet, as Obaku says, “To make the Buddha seek after himself, 
or to make the mind take hold of itself—this is an impossibility to the end 
of eternity.” According to Hyakujo, “It is much like looking for an ox when 
you are riding on it”—or, as one of the poems in the Zenrin-kushu puts it, it is 


Like a sword that wounds, but cannot wound itself; 
Like an eye that sees, but cannot see itself."* 


In the words of an old Chinese popular saying, “A single hand cannot make a 
clap.” Yet Hakuin always introduced his students to Zen by asking them to 
hear the sound of one hand! 

It is not difficult to see that there is a common pattern underlying all these 
four types of answer, since all the answers are circular. If all things are the 
One, then my feeling of conflict between dualities is also the One, as well as 
my objection to this feeling. If all things are Void, then the thought that this 
is so is also Void, and I feel as if I am being asked to fall into a hole and pull 
the hole in after me. If everything that happens is perfectly right and natural 
just as it is, then the wrong and unnatural is also natural. If I am just to let 
things happen, what happens when one of these things is precisely my desire 
to interfere with the course of events? And finally, if the root of the conflict is 
a lack of self-understanding, how can I understand the self which is trying to 
understand itself? In short, the root of the problem is the question. If you do 
not ask the question the problem will not arise. To put it another way, the prob- 
lem of how to escape from conflict is the very conflict one is trying to escape. 

If all these answers are not particularly helpful, this is only to say that the 
human situation is one for which there is no help. Every remedy for suffer- 
ing is after all like changing one’s position on a hard bed, and every advance 
in the control of our environment makes the environment harder to control. 


132 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


Nevertheless, all this mental circulation does at least seem to produce two 
rather definite conclusions. The first is that if we do not try to help ourselves, 
we shall never realize how helpless we are. Only by ceaseless questioning can 
we begin to realize the limits, and thus the very form, of the human mind. 
The second is that when we do at last realize the depths of our helplessness, 
we are at peace. We have given ourselves up for lost, and this is what is meant 
by losing oneself, or by self-surrender, or self-sacrifice. 

Perhaps this will throw some light on the Buddhist doctrine of the Void, 
on the saying that all is in reality empty or in vain. For if the deepest impulse 
of my being is to escape from a conflict which is substantially identical with 
my desire to escape from conflict; if, in other words, the entire structure of 
myself, my ego, is an attempt to do the impossible, then I am in vain or void 
to the very core. I am simply an itch that has nothing upon which to scratch 
itself. Trying to scratch makes the itch worse, but an itch is, by definition, what 
wants to be scratched. 

Zen is therefore trying to communicate a vivid realization of the vicious 
circularity, the helplessness, and the plain impossibility of the human situation, 
of that desire for harmony which is precisely conflict, that desire which is our 
core, our very will-to-live. This would be a masochistic discipline of pure self- 
frustration, were it not for very curious and seemingly paradoxical consequences. 
When it is clear beyond all doubt that the itch cannot be scratched, it stops 
itching by itself. When it is realized that our basic desire is a vicious circle, it 
stops circling of its own accord. But this happens only when it has become 
utterly clear and certain that there is no way of making it stop. 

The attempt to make oneself do or not do something implies, of course, 
an inner, subjective duality—a splitting asunder of the mind’s integrity, which 
brings about a paralysis of action. To some extent, then, the statement that all 
is One and One is all is actually expressing the end of this inner split, and the 
discovery of the mind’s original unity and autonomy. It is not unlike learning 
the use of a new muscle—when suddenly you move it from inside, or rather, 
it moves itself, after all efforts to force it from without have been unavailing. 
This type of experience is vivid enough, but, as we all know, practically impos- 
sible to communicate. 

It is important to remember that the state of mind out of which this 
new experience of unity arises is one of total futility. In Zen it is likened to 
the predicament of a mosquito biting an iron bull, or, as another poem in the 
Zenrin-kushu expresses it: 


To trample upon the Great Void 
The Iron Bull must sweat." 


But how will an iron bull sweat? It is the same question as “How can I escape 
from conflict?” or “How can I catch hold of myself, or of my own hand?” 


THE WAY OF LIBERATION IN ZEN BUDDHISM 133 


Now in the intensity of this complete impasse, in which the radical impotence 
of the ego is vividly understood, it is suddenly realized that—nevertheless— 
there is a great process of life still going on. “I stand and I sit; I clothe myself 
and I eat. . . . The water flows blue, and the mountain towers green. . . . The 
wind blows in the trees, and cars honk in the distance.” With my ordinary self 
reduced to nothing but a completely useless straining I suddenly realize that 
all this is my real activity—that the activity of my ego has been displaced by 
the total activity of life, in such a way that the rigid boundary between myself 
and everything else has completely disappeared. All events whatsoever, whether 
the raising of my own hand or the chattering of a bird outside, are seen to be 
happening shizen,'’ “by themselves” or “automatically,” in the spontaneous as 
distinct from the mechanical sense of the word. 


The blue mountains are of themselves blue mountains; 
The white clouds are of themselves white clouds." 


And the raising of a hand, the thinking of a thought, or the making of a 
decision happen in just the same way. It becomes clear that this is, in fact, the 
way things have always been happening, and that therefore all my efforts to 
move myself or to control myself have been irrelevant—having had the sole 
value of proving that it cannot be done. The whole concept of self-control 
has been misconstrued, since it is as impossible to make oneself relax, or make 
oneself do anything, as to open one’s mouth by the exclusively mental act of 
willing it to open. No matter how much the will is strained and thought is 
concentrated on the idea of opening, the mouth will remain unmoved until it 
opens itself. It was out of this sense of all events happening “by themselves” 
that the poet Hokoji wrote: 


Miraculous power and marvelous activity— 
Drawing water and hewing wood!” 


This state of consciousness is by no means a psychological impossibility, 
even as a more or less continuous feeling. Throughout the course of their 
lives most people seem to feel more or less continuously the rigid distinction 
between the ego and its environment. Release from this feeling is like release 
from a chronic illness, and is followed by a sense of lightness and ease com- 
parable to being relieved of the burden of a huge plaster cast. Naturally the 
immediate sense of euphoria or ecstasy wears off in the course of time, but 
the permanent absence of the rigid ego-environment boundary remains as a 
significant change in the structure or our experience. It is of no consequence 
that the ecstasy wears off, for the compulsive craving for ecstasy disappears, 
having formerly existed by way of compensation for the chronic frustration of 
living in a vicious circle. 


134 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


To some extent the rigid distinction between ego and environment is equiva- 
lent to that between mind and body, or between the voluntary and involuntary 
neural systems. This is probably the reason why Zen and yoga disciplines pay 
so much attention to breathing, to watching over the breath (anapranasmrti), 
since it is in this organic function that we can see most easily the essential 
identity of voluntary and involuntary action. We cannot help breathing, and yet 
it seems that breath is under our control; we both breathe and are breathed. 
For the distinction of the voluntary and the involuntary is valid only within a 
somewhat limited perspective. Strictly speaking, I will or decide involuntarily. 
Were it not so, it would always be necessary for me to decide to decide and to 
decide to decide to decide in an infinite regress. Now the involuntary processes 
of the body, such as the beating of the heart, do not seem to differ very much 
in principle from other involuntary actions going on outside the body. Both are, 
as it were, environmental. When, therefore, the distinction of voluntary and 
involuntary is transcended within the body, it is also transcended with respect 
to events outside the body. 

When, therefore, it is understood that these ego-environment and voluntary- 
involuntary distinctions are conventional, and valid only within limited and 
somewhat arbitrary perspectives, we find ourselves in a kind of experiencing 
to which such expressions as “One is All and All is One” are quite appropriate. 
For this one-ness represents the disappearance of a fixed barrier, or a rigid dual- 
ism. But it is in no sense a “one-thing-ness”—a type of pantheism or monism 
asserting that all so-called things are the illusory forms of one homogeneous 
“stuff.” The experience of release from dualism is not to be understood as 
the sudden disappearance of mountains and trees, houses and people, into a 
uniform mass of light or transparent voidness. 

For this reason the Zen masters have always recognized that “the One” is 
a somewhat misleading term. In the words of the Shinjinmei: 


There are two because there is One, 
Yet cling not to this One... 

In the dharma-world of true Suchness 
There is neither “other” nor “self,” 

If you want an immediate answer, 


2320 


We can only say “Not two. 


Hence the koan question, “When the many are reduced to the One, to what 
shall the One be reduced?” To this Joshu replied, “When I was in Seiju Province, 
I made a linen robe weighing nine pounds.””' Strange as it may sound, it is in 
this type of language that Zen expresses itself most plainly, for this is a direct 
language without the least element of symbolism or conceptualism. After all, 
it is so easy to forget that what is being expressed here is not an idea or an 
opinion, but an experience. For Zen does not speak from the external standpoint 
of one who stands outside life and comments upon it. This is a standpoint from 


THE WAY OF LIBERATION IN ZEN BUDDHISM 135 


which effective understanding is impossible, just as it is impossible to move a 
muscle by nothing more than verbal commands, however strenuously spoken. 

There is, of course, a permanent value in being able, as it were, to stand 
aside from life and reflect upon it, in being aware of one’s own existence, in 
having what communications engineers would call a psychological feedback 
system that enables us to criticize and correct our actions. But systems of 
this kind have their limitations, and a moment’s consideration of the analogy 
of feedback will show where they lie. Probably the most familiar example of 
feedback is the electrical thermostat which regulates the heating of a house. 
By setting an upper and lower limit of desired temperature, a thermometer is 
so connected that it will switch the heat on when the lower limit is reached, 
and off when the upper limit is reached. The temperature of the rooms is thus 
kept within the desired limits. We might say, then, that the thermostat is a kind 
of sensitive organ which the furnace acquires in order to regulate its own con- 
duct, and that this is a very rudimentary analogy of human self-consciousness. 

But having thus constructed a self-regulating furnace, how about construct- 
ing a self-regulating thermostat? We are all familiar enough with the vagaries of 
thermostats, and it might be a fine idea to install a second feedback system to 
control the first. But then there arises the problem of how far can this go. Fol- 
lowed logically to its limits, it implies an indefinite series of feedbacks controlling 
feedbacks, which, beyond a certain point, would paralyze the whole system with 
the confusion of complexity. If it is to be avoided, there must, somewhere at the 
end of the line, be a thermostat or a source of intelligence whose information 
and authority is to be trusted, and not subjected to further checks and controls. 
For to this the only alternative is an infinite series of controls, which is absurd, 
since a point would arrive when the information would never reach the furnace. 
It might seem that another alternative would be a circular system of control, as 
when the civilian is controlled by the policeman, who is controlled by the mayor, 
who is controlled by the civilian. But this works only when each member trusts 
the one above it, or, to put it in another way, when the system trusts itself—and 
does not keep on trying to stand outside itself to correct itself. 

This gives us rather a vivid picture of the human predicament. Our life 
consists essentially in action, but we have the power to check action by reflec- 
tion. Too much reflection inhibits and paralyzes action, but because action is 
a matter of life or death, how much reflection is necessary? In so far as Zen 
describes its fundamental attitude as mushin or munen,” “no-mind” or “no- 
thought” it seems to stand for action as against reflection. 


In walking, just walk. In sitting, just sit. 
Above all, don’t wobble.” 


Joshu’s answer to the question about the many and the One was simply unre- 
flective action, unpremeditated speech. “When I was in Seiju Province I made 
a linen robe weighing nine pounds.” 


136 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


But reflection is also action, and Zen might equally well say: “In acting, just 
act. In thinking, just think. Above all, don’t wobble.” In other words, if you are 
going to reflect, to think, just reflect, but do not reflect about reflecting. And 
Zen would also agree that reflection about reflection is action, provided that 
in doing it we do just that, and have no tendency to drift off into the infinite 
regression of trying always to stand above or outside the level upon which we 
are acting. In short, Zen is also a liberation from the dualism of thought versus 
action, for it thinks as it acts—with the same quality of abandon, commitment, 
or faith. Thus the attitude of mushin is by no means an anti-intellectualist exclu- 
sion of thinking. It is action upon any level whatsoever, physical or psychic, 
without trying at the same moment to observe and check the action from outside, 
that is, without wobbling or anxiety. 

Needless to say, what is true of the relationship of thinking to action is 
also true of feeling, since our feelings or emotions about life are as much a 
type of feedback as our thoughts. Feeling blocks action, and blocks itself as a 
form of action, when it gets caught in this same tendency to observe or feel 
itself indefinitely—as for example, when, in the midst of enjoying myself thor- 
oughly, I examine myself to see if I am getting the utmost out of the occasion. 
Not content with tasting the food, I am trying also to taste my tongue. Not 
content with feeling happy, I want to feel myself feeling happy—so as to be 
sure not to miss anything. 

Obviously there is no fixed way of determining the exact point where 
reflection must turn into action in any given situation, of knowing that we 
have given the matter enough thought to act without regret. This is always 
a problem of sensibility, of nice judgment. But the fact remains that however 
skillfully and carefully our reflecting is done, its conclusions are always a long 
way short of certainty. Ultimately, every action is a leap into the dark. The 
only real certainty that we have about the future is that unknown quantity 
called death, standing as the final symbol of the fact that our lives are not in 
our own control. In other words, human life is founded upon an irreducible 
element of the unknown and the uncontrolled, which is the Buddhist sunya or 
Void and which is the mushin or “no-mind” of Zen. But Zen is—beyond this— 
the realization that I do not merely stand on this unknown, or float upon it in 
the frail barque of my body: it is the realization that this unknown is myself. 

From the standpoint of vision, my own head is an empty space in the 
midst of experience—an invisible and inconceivable void which is neither dark 
nor light. This same voidness stands behind each one of our senses—both the 
external or exteroceptive and the internal or proprioceptive senses. It stands, 
too, beyond the beginnings of my life, beyond my conception in my mother’s 
womb. It stands at the center of the very nuclear structure of my organism. 
For when the physicist tries to penetrate this structure he finds that the very 
act of looking into it obscures what he wants to see. This is an example of 
the same principle that we have encountered all along—that in trying to look 
into themselves, the eyes turn away from themselves. This is why it is usual 


THE WAY OF LIBERATION IN ZEN BUDDHISM 137 


to begin training in Zen with one of the many forms of the koan, “Who are 
you?” “Before father and mother, what is your original nature?” “Who is it that 
carries this corpse around?” 

By such means it is discovered that our “self-nature” (svabhava) is “no- 
nature,” that our real mind (shin) is “no-mind” (mushin). To the extent, then, 
that we realize that the unknown and the inconceivable is our own original 
nature, it no longer stands over against us as a threatening object. It is not so 
much the abyss into which we are falling; it is rather that out of which we 
act and live, think and feel. 

Again, we can see the appropriateness of the language of unity. There 
is no longer a fixed dualism between reflection and action. More important 
still, there is no longer a separation of the knower on the one hand and the 
unknown on the other. Reflection is action, and the knower is the unknown. 
We can see, too, the appropriateness of such remarks as Hui Hai’s “Act as 
you will; go on as you feel, without second thought. This is the incomparable 
Way.” For sayings of this kind are not intended to discourage ordinary reflec- 
tion, judgment, and restraint. Their application is not superficial but profound. 
That is to say, in the final analysis we have to act and think, live and die, 
from a source beyond all our knowledge and control. If this is unfortunate, 
no amount of care and hesitancy, no amount of introspection and search- 
ing of our motives, can make any ultimate difference to it. We are therefore 
compelled to choose between a shuddering paralysis or a leap into action 
regardless of the ultimate consequences. Superficially speaking, our actions 
may be right or wrong with respect to relative standards. But our decisions 
upon this superficial level must be supported by the underlying conviction that 
whatever we do and whatever happens to us is ultimately “right”—which is a 
way of saying that we must enter into it without “second thought,” without 
the arriére pensée of regret, hesitancy, doubt, or self-recrimination. Thus when 
Ummon was asked, “What is the Tao?” he answered simply, “Walk on!”* But 
to act without second thought is not by any means a mere precept for our 
imitation. It is actually impossible to realize this kind of action until we have 
understood that we have no other alternative, until we have realized that we 
ourselves are the unknown and the uncontrolled. 

So far as Zen is concerned, this realization is little more than the first step 
in a long course of study. For it must be remembered that Zen is a form of 
Mahayana Buddhism, in which Nirvana—liberation from the vicious circle of 
Samsara—is not so much the final goal as the beginning of the life of the Bod- 
hisattva. The concern of the Bodhisattva is upaya or hoben,” the application of 
this realization to every aspect of life for the “liberation of all sentient beings,” 
not only human and animal, but also trees, grass, and the very dust.* It might 
be said, then, that the real discipline of Zen begins only at the point where the 
individual has altogether stopped trying to improve himself. This appears to be 
a contradiction because we are almost completely unaccustomed to the idea of 
effortless-effort, of tension without conflict and concentration without strain. 


138 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


But it is fundamental to Zen that a person who is trying to improve himself, 
to become something more than he is, is incapable of creative action. In the 
words of Rinzai, “If you seek deliberately to become a Buddha, your Buddha 
is just Samsara.” Or again, “If a person seeks the Tao, that person loses the 
Tao.”’® The reason is simply that the attempt to improve or act upon oneself 
is a way of locking action in a vicious circle, like trying to bite one’s own 
teeth. Release from this ridiculous predicament is achieved, at the very begin- 
ning of Zen discipline, by understanding that “you yourself as you are, are the 
Buddha.” For the object of Zen is not so much to become a Buddha as to act 
like one. Therefore no progress can be made in the life of the Bodhisattva so 
long as there is the least anxiety or striving to become more than what one is. 
Similarly, a person who tries to concentrate upon a certain task with a result 
in mind will forget the task in thinking about its result. 

The irrelevance of self-improvement is expressed in two poems of the 
Zenrin Kushu: 


A long thing is the long body of Buddha; 

A short thing is the short body of Buddha.”” 

In the landscape of spring there is no measure of worth or value; 
The flowering branches are naturally short and long.” 


Or the following from Goso: 


If you look for the Buddha, you will not see the Buddha; 
If you seek the Patriarch, you will not see the Patriarch. 
The sweet melon is sweet even through the stem; 

The bitter gourd is bitter even to the roots.” 


Some Buddhas are short and some are long; some students are beginners, and 
others are far advanced, but each is “right” just exactly as he is. For if he strives 
to make himself better, he falls into the vicious circle of egoism. It is perhaps 
difficult for the Western mind to appreciate that man develops by growth 
rather than self-improvement, and that neither the body nor the mind grows 
by stretching itself. As the seed becomes the tree, the short Buddha becomes 
the long Buddha. It is not a question of improvement, for a tree is not an 
improved seed, and it is even in perfect accord with nature or Tao that many 
seeds never become trees. Seeds lead to plants, and plants lead to seeds. There 
is no question of higher or lower, better or worse, for the process is fulfilled 
in each moment of its activity. 

A philosophy of nonstriving or mui’? always raises the problem of incentive, 
for if people are “right” or Buddhas just as they are, does not this self-acceptance 
destroy the creative urge? The answer is that there is nothing truly creative 
about actions which spring from incentives, for these are not so much free or 
creative actions as conditioned reactions. True creation is always purposeless, 


THE WAY OF LIBERATION IN ZEN BUDDHISM 139 


without ulterior motive, which is why it is said that the true artist copies nature 
in the manner of her operation and understands the real meaning of “art for 
art’s sake.” As Kojisei wrote in his Saikontan: 


If your true nature has the creative force of Nature itself, wherever you 
may go, you will see (all things as) fishes leaping and geese flying.’ 


ENGLISH NOTES 


“I wish to take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to my assistant, Miss 
Lois Thille, for many hours of secretarial help, and also to Mr. Wing Hoh, for transcrib- 
ing my atrocious Chinese characters into a legible and elegant form. 

In Zen, however, the idea of Samsara as a process of cyclic reincarnation is not 
taken literally, and thus Zen has its own special meaning for the Bodhisattva’s task of 
delivering all things from the course of endless birth and death. In one sense, the cycle 
of birth and death is from moment to moment, and a person may be said to be involved 
in Samsara to the extent that he identifies himself with an ego continuing through time.

Beat Zen, Square Zen, and Zen (1958) 


[ is as difficult for Anglo-Saxons as for the Japanese to absorb 
anything quite so Chinese as Zen. For though the word “Zen” is 
Japanese and though Japan is now its home, Zen Buddhism is the creation 
of T’ang dynasty China. I do not say this as a prelude to harping upon the 
incommunicable subtleties of alien cultures. The point is simply that people 
who feel a profound need to justify themselves have difficulty in understanding 
the viewpoints of those who do not, and the Chinese who created Zen were 
the same kind of people as Lao-Tzu, who, centuries before, had said, “Those 
who justify themselves do not convince.” For the urge to make or prove 
oneself right has always jiggled the Chinese sense of the ludicrous, since as 
both Confucians and Taoists—however different these philosophies in other 
ways—they have invariably appreciated the man who can “come off it.” To 
Confucius it seemed much better to be human-hearted than righteous, and 
to the great Taoists, Lao-Tzu and Chuang-Tzu, it was obvious that one could 
not be right without also being wrong, because the two were as inseparable 
as back and front. As Chuang-Tzu said, “Those who would have good govern- 
ment without its correlative misrule, and right without its correlative wrong, 
do not understand the principles of the universe.” 

To Western ears such words may sound cynical, and the Confucian admira- 
tion of “reasonableness” and compromise may appear to be a weak-kneed lack 
of commitment to principle. Actually they reflect a marvelous understanding 
and respect for what we call the balance of nature, human and otherwise—a 
universal vision of life as the Tao or way of nature in which the good and the

evil, the creative and the destructive, the wise and the foolish are the insepa- 
rable polarities of existence. “Tao,” said the Chung-yung, “is that from which 
one cannot depart. That from which one can depart is not the Tao.” Therefore 
wisdom did not consist in trying to wrest the good from the evil but in learning 
to “ride” them as a cork adapts itself to the crests and troughs of the waves. 
At the roots of Chinese life there is a trust in the good-and-evil of one’s own 
nature which is peculiarly foreign to those brought up with the chronic uneasy 
conscience of the Hebrew-Christian cultures. Yet it was always obvious to the 
Chinese that a man who mistrusts himself cannot even trust his mistrust, and 
must therefore be hopelessly confused. 

For rather different reasons, Japanese people tend to be as uneasy in 
themselves as Westerners, having a sense of social shame quite as acute as 
our more metaphysical sense of sin. This was especially true of the class most 
attracted to Zen, the samurai. Ruth Benedict, in that very uneven work Chry- 
santhemum and Sword, was, | think, perfectly correct in saying that the attraction 
of Zen to the samurai class was its power to get rid of an extremely awkward 
self-consciousness induced in the education of the young. Part-and-parcel of 
this self-consciousness is the Japanese compulsion to compete with oneself—a 
compulsion that turns every craft and skill into a marathon of self-discipline. 
Although the attraction of Zen lay in the possibility of liberation from self- 
consciousness, the Japanese version of Zen fought fire with fire, overcoming 
the “self observing the self” by bringing it to an intensity in which it exploded. 
How remote from the regimen of the Japanese Zen Monastery are the words 
of the great T’ang master Lin-chi: 


In Buddhism there is no place for using effort. Just be ordinary and 
nothing special. Eat your food, move your bowels, pass water, and 
when you're tired go and lie down. The ignorant will laugh at me, 
but the wise will understand. 


Yet the spirit of these words is just as remote from a kind of Western Zen 
that would employ this philosophy to justify a very self-defensive Bohemianism. 

There is no single reason for the extraordinary growth of Western interest 
in Zen during the last twenty years. The appeal of Zen arts to the “modern” 
spirit in the West, the work of Suzuki, the war with Japan, the itchy fascination 
of “Zen-stories,” and the attraction of a nonconceptual, experiential philosophy 
in the climate of scientific relativism—all these are involved. One might men- 
tion, too, the affinities between Zen and such purely Western trends as the 
philosophy of Wittgenstein, Existentialism, General Semantics, the metalinguis- 
tics of B. L. Whorf, and certain movements in the philosophy of science and 
in psychotherapy. Always in the background there is our vague disquiet with 
the artificiality or “anti-naturalness” of both Christianity, with its politically 
ordered cosmology, and technology, with its imperialistic mechanization of a 


BEAT ZEN, SQUARE ZEN, AND ZEN 145 


natural world from which man himself feels strangely alien. For both reflect 
a psychology in which man is identified with a conscious intelligence and will 
standing apart from nature to control it, like the architect-God in whose image 
this version of man is conceived. The disquiet arises from the suspicion that 
our attempt to master the world from outside is a vicious circle in which we 
shall be condemned to the perpetual insomnia of controlling controls and 
supervising supervision ad infinitum. 

To the Westerner in search of the reintegration of man and nature there 
is an appeal far beyond the merely sentimental in the naturalism of Zen—in 
the landscapes of Ma-yuan and Sesshu, in an art that is simultaneously spiri- 
tual and secular, which conveys the mystical in terms of the natural, and that, 
indeed, never even imagined a break between them. Here is a view of the world 
imparting a profoundly refreshing sense of wholeness to a culture in which the 
spiritual and the material, the conscious and the unconscious, have been cata- 
clysmically split. For this reason the Chinese humanism and naturalism of Zen 
intrigue us much more strongly than Indian Buddhism or Vedanta. These, too, 
have their students in the West, but their followers seem for the most part to 
be displaced Christians—people in search of a more plausible philosophy than 
Christian supernaturalism to carry on the essentially Christian search for the 
miraculous. The ideal man of Indian Buddhism is clearly a superman, a yogi 
with absolute mastery of his own nature, according perfectly with the science- 
fiction ideal of “men beyond mankind.” But the Buddha or awakened man of 
Chinese Zen is “ordinary and nothing special”; he is humorously human like 
the Zen tramps portrayed by Mu-chi and Liang-k’ai. We like this because here, 
for the first time, is a conception of the holy man and sage who is not impos- 
sibly remote, not superhuman but fully human, and, above all, not a solemn 
and sexless ascetic. Furthermore, in Zen the satori experience of awakening to 
our “original inseparability” with the universe seems, however elusive, always 
just around the corner. One has even met people to whom it has happened, 
and they are no longer mysterious occultists in the Himalayas nor skinny yogis 
in cloistered ashrams. They are just like us, and yet much more at home in the 
world, floating much more easily upon the ocean of transience and insecurity. 

But the Westerner who is attracted by Zen and who would understand it 
deeply must have one indispensable qualification: he must understand his own 
culture so thoroughly that he is no longer swayed by its premises unconsciously. 
He must really have come to terms with the Lord God Jehovah and with his 
Hebrew-Christian conscience so that he can take it or leave it without fear or 
rebellion. He must be free of the itch to justify himself. Lacking this, his Zen 
will be either “beat” or “square,” either a revolt from the culture and social 
order or a new form of stuffiness and respectability. For Zen is above all the 
liberation of the mind from conventional thought, and this is something utterly 
different from rebellion against convention, on the one hand, or adopting foreign 
conventions, on the other. 


146 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


Conventional thought is, in brief, the confusion of the concrete universe of 
nature with the conceptual things, events, and values of linguistic and cultural 
symbolism. For in Taoism and Zen the world is seen as an inseparably inter- 
related field or continuum, no part of which can actually be separated from the 
rest or valued above or below the rest. It was in this sense that Hui-neng, the 
Sixth Patriarch, meant that “fundamentally not one thing exists,” for he realized 
that things are terms, not entities. They exists in the abstract world of thought, 
but not in the concrete world of nature. Thus one who actually perceives or 
feels this to be so no longer feels that he is an ego, except by definition. He 
sees that his ego is his persona or social role, a somewhat arbitrary selection 
of experiences with which he has been taught to identify himself. (Why, for 
example, do we say “I think” but not “I am beating my heart”?) Having seen 
this, he continues to play his social role without being taken in by it. He does 
not precipitately adopt a new role or play the role of having no role at all. 
He plays it cool. 

The “beat” mentality as I am thinking of it is something much more 
extensive and vague than the hipster life of New York and San Francisco. It is 
a younger generation’s nonparticipation in “the American Way of Life,” a revolt 
that does not seek to change the existing order but simply turns away from 
it to find the significance of life in subjective experience rather than objective 
achievement. It contrasts with the “square” and other-directed mentality of 
beguilement by social convention, unaware of the correlativity of right and 
wrong, of the mutual necessity of capitalism and communism to each other’s 
existence, of the inner identity of puritanism and lechery, or of, say, the alliance 
of church lobbies and organized crime to maintain the laws against gambling. 

Beat Zen is a complex phenomenon. It ranges from a use of Zen for jus- 
tifying sheer caprice in art, literature, and life to a very forceful social criticism 
and “digging of the universe” such as one may find in the poetry of Ginsberg 
and Snyder, and, rather unevenly, in Kerouac. But, as I know it, it is always a 
shade too self-conscious, too subjective, and too strident to have the flavor of 
Zen. It is all very well for the philosopher, but when the poet (Ginsberg) says— 


live 
in the physical world 
moment to moment 


I must write down 
every recurring thought— 
stop every beating second 


This is too indirect and didactic for Zen, which would rather hand you the 
thing itself without comment. 


BEAT ZEN, SQUARE ZEN, AND ZEN 147 


The sea darkens; 
The voices of the wild ducks 
Are faintly white. 


Furthermore, when Kerouac gives his philosophical final statement, “I don’t 
know. I don’t care. And it doesn’t make any difference”—the cat is out of the 
bag, for there is a hostility in these words that clangs with self-defense. But just 
because Zen truly surpasses convention and its values, it has no need to say 
“To hell with it,” nor to underline with violence the fact that anything goes. 

Now the underlying protestant lawlessness of beat Zen disturbs the square 
Zennists very seriously. For square Zen is the Zen of established tradition in 
Japan with its clearly defined hierarchy, its rigid discipline, and its specific tests 
of satori. More particularly, it is the kind of Zen adopted by Westerners study- 
ing in Japan, who will before long be bringing it back home. But there is an 
obvious difference between square Zen and the common-or-garden squareness 
of the Rotary Club or the Presbyterian Church. It is infinitely more imaginative, 
sensitive and interesting. But it is still square because it is a quest for the right 
spiritual experience, for a satori, which will receive the stamp (inka) of approval 
and established authority. There will even be certificates to hang on the wall. 

I see no real quarrel with either extreme. There was never a spiritual move- 
ment without its excesses and distortions. The experience of awakening which 
truly constitutes Zen is too timeless and universal to be injured. The extremes 
of beat Zen need alarm no one since, as Blake said, “the fool who persists in his 
folly will become wise.” As for square Zen, “authoritative” spiritual experiences 
have always had a way of wearing thin, and thus of generating the demand 
for something genuine and unique that needs no stamp. 

I have known followers of both extremes to come up with perfectly clear 
satori experiences, for since there is no real “way” to satori the way you are 
following makes very little difference. 

But the quarrel between the extremes is of great philosophical interest, 
being a contemporary form of the ancient dispute between salvation by works 
and salvation by faith, or between what the Hindus called the ways of the 
monkey and the cat. The cat—appropriately enough—follows the effortless 
way, since the mother cat carries her kittens. The monkey follows the hard 
way, since the baby monkey has to hang on to its mother’s hair. Thus for 
beat Zen there must be no effort, no discipline, no artificial striving to attain 
satori or to be anything but what one is. But for square Zen there can be no 
true satori without years of meditation-practice under the stern supervision 
of a qualified master. In seventeenth-century Japan these two attitudes were 
approximately typified by the great masters Bankei and Hakuin, and it so hap- 
pens that the followers of the latter “won out” and determined the present-day 
character of Rinzai Zen.' 


148 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


Satori can lie along both roads. It is the concomitant of a “nongrasping” 
attitude of the senses to experience, and grasping can be exhausted by the 
discipline of directing its utmost intensity to single, ever-elusive objective. But 
what makes the way of effort and will-power suspect to many Westerners is not 
so much an inherent laziness as a thorough familiarity with the wisdom of our 
own culture. The square Western Zennists are often quite naive when it comes 
to an understanding of Christian theology or of all that has been discovered 
in modern psychiatry, for both have long been concerned with the fallibility 
and unconscious ambivalence of the will. Both have posed problems as to the 
vicious circle of seeking self-surrender or of “free-associating on purpose” or 
of accepting one’s conflicts to escape from them, and to anyone who knows 
anything about either Christianity or psychotherapy these are very real prob- 
lems. The interest of Chinese Zen and of people like Bankei is that they deal 
with these problems in a most direct and stimulating way, and begin to suggest 
some answers. But when Herrigel’s Japanese archery master was asked, “How 
can I give up purpose on purpose?” he replied that no one had ever asked him 
that before. He had no answer except to go on trying blindly, or five years. 

Foreign religions can be immensely attractive and highly overrated by those 
who know little of their own, and especially by those who have not worked 
through or grown out of their own. This is why the displaced or unconscious 
Christian can so easily use either beat or square Zen to justify himself. The one 
wants a philosophy to justify him in doing what he pleases. The other wants a 
more plausible authoritative salvation than the Church or the psychiatrists seem 
to be able to provide. Furthermore the atmosphere of Japanese Zen is free 
from all one’s unpleasant childhood associations with God the Father and Jesus 
Christ—though I know many young Japanese who feel just the same way about 
their early training in Buddhism. But the true character of Zen remains almost 
incomprehensible to those who have not surpassed the immaturity of needing 
to be justified, whether before the Lord God or before a paternalistic society. 

The old Chinese Zen masters were steeped in Taoism. They saw nature 
in its total interrelatedness, and saw that every creature and every experience 
is in accord with the Tao of nature just as it is. This enabled them to accept 
themselves as they were, moment by moment, without the least need to justify 
anything. They didn’t do it to defend themselves or to find an excuse for getting 
away with murder. They didn’t brag about it and set themselves apart as rather 
special. On the contrary, their Zen was wu-shih, which means approximately 
“nothing special” or “no fuss.” But Zen is “fuss” when it is mixed up with 
Bohemian affectations, and “fuss” when it is imagined that the only proper 
way to find it is to run off to a monastery in Japan or to do special exercises 
in the lotus posture or five hours a day. And I will admit that the very hullaba- 
loo about Zen, even in such an article as this, is also fuss—but a little less so. 

Having said that, I would like to say something for all Zen fussers, beat 
or square. Fuss is all right, too. If you are hung on Zen, there’s no need to 


BEAT ZEN, SQUARE ZEN, AND ZEN 149 


try and pretend that you are not. If you really want to spend some years in a 
Japanese monastery, there is no earthly reason why you shouldn't. Or if you 
want to spend your time hopping freight cars and digging Charlie parker, it’s 
a free country.

NOTE 


1. Rinzai Zen is the form most widely known in the West. There is also Soto Zen, 
which differs somewhat in technique, but still closer to Hakuin than to Bankei. However, 
Bankei should not exactly be identified with beat Zen as I have described it, for he was 
certainly no advocate of the life of undisciplined whimsy despite all that he said about 
the importance of the uncalculated life and folly of seeking satori. 


CHAPTER TEN 


Zen and Politics (1962) 


he title of Mr. Braun’s (1961) article “The Politics of Zen” in itself 

contains the whole fallacy upon which his diatribe is based, for it 
is almost as if one were to speak of “the politics of physics” or of “the ethical 
implications of sight.” It is perhaps natural for us to think of Zen as a religion, 
and thus as a way of life having the same function in the cultures of the Far 
East as Christianity and Judaism in our own. Though the political records of 
the latter are none to clean, these religions have an avowedly ethical function: 
they believe alike that salvation comes by virtue of membership in a loving 
community—the Church, or the people of God. By deliberate intention, then, 
such religions are politically and morally normative. 

But this is not the function of such disciplines as physics or even medicine. 
Perfectly sound physical or medical knowledge may be used for good or evil 
ends. Western physics made possible the unimaginable tortures of Hiroshima, 
and the healing of a lame man may enable him to kick his children. Would 
Mr. Braun suggest, then, that physics and medicine be abandoned? Or would 
he suggest that clear eyesight is a menace because it enables us to aim rifles? 

Now Zen is somewhat like a science and somewhat like a highly sensitized 
faculty of perception, the combination of a certain kind of knowledge and skill. 
As knowledge, it is the direct (almost sensory) state of affairs which some sci- 
entists describe theoretically as the reciprocal or “transactional” behavior of an 
organism and its environment. It enables one to not only think but also to feel 
that organism/environment or man/universe is a unified field of behavior—as 
is, indeed, known to be the case in such sciences as ecology and biology. I have

152 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


sometimes called Zen the immediate perception of relativity, or of the inseparable 
relatedness of all things and events. As skill, Zen comprises an art of freeing 
thought and action from what psychologists call “blocking” or from being non- 
plussed by certain types of dilemma. These dilemmas are approximately what 
some modern philosophers would term pseudo-problems or pseudo-alternatives. 
For example, “Where was your fist before you closed your hand?” is analogous 
to the Zen koan “Who were you before your mother and father conceived you?” 

It is perfectly obvious that knowledge and skill of these kinds can be used 
in any form of action, and that they are as ethically neutral as electronics. Just 
as it is quite proper for us to question the political and ethical principles of 
men who employ the sciences, not the ethics of physics but of physicists, so 
it would have been quite proper for Mr. Braun to question the political inten- 
tions of various individuals who employ Zen. He would then have to direct his 
criticism to the philosophies or ideologies which do in fact provide the moral 
and political values of Far Eastern cultures—e.g., Confucianism and Shinto, 
and their derivatives. 

Zen is concerned with the basic characteristics of life and the universe, 
but, unlike Christianity (which is similarly concerned), it does not seek in this 
realm for ethical directives. Christianity does so because of its belief in a per- 
sonal God who is the guarantor of a supernatural and absolute moral order, 
but I doubt Mr. Braun would want to invoke this type of sanction for political 
ethics, for in its own way it is as dangerous as none at all. It is not subject to 
critical analysis, experiment, and change. As I see it and, as I am sure, many 
Zen Buddhists see it, the foundation for ethics is not to be found in science, 
metaphysics, or mysticism, but in mutual agreement between human beings as 
to how they want to behave. Ethically, we are not so much trains in search of 
rails as pilots in search of agreement as to schedules and air-lanes. 

Mr. Braun, in common with many others, has of course been influenced 
by Arthur Koestler’s (1960) astonishingly poor piece of reporting, The Lotus and 
the Robot, especially the incident in the book where a Zen abbot refuses “to 
pass ethical judgment on Hitler’s murder of the Jews.” Readers of Koestler will 
remember that on this occasion the abbot characterized Hitler’s behavior as 
“foolish” rather than “sinful.” I do not know what sort of interpreter was present 
at this interview, so I can only guess that the abbot attributed Hitler’s action, 
as would any Buddhist, to mu-myo, which is roughly translatable as “ignorance” 
or “unconsciousness.” The abbot would have had no word for “sin” because he 
had no theology in which sin is the transgression of a supernatural moral order. 
Perhaps Koestler was offended because the abbot expressed no human horror. 
But I would suggest that a surgeon who gives way to human horror before a 
cancer operation may cut with an unsteady hand. The legitimate moral charge 
is that the Japanese did not act as surgeons in identifying Nazism and their own 
militarism as diseases, and this was the defect not of their Zen-vision, but of 
their value-judgments and the ethical systems underlying them. If all this made 


ZEN AND POLITICS 153 


Koestler lose his interest in Oriental art, did it, I wonder, destroy his interest 
in Goethe and Schiller, Rilke and Bach? 

In short, Mr. Braun has directed a very proper criticism of Japanese political 
ethics to the wrong address. His mistake, which I do not believe he would have 
made if he had read my own work carefully, was to identify Zen as a religious 
phenomenon from which one would expect judgments of value. This is simply 
not its sphere, just as it is not the sphere of medicine or logic as such. These 
deplorable cruelties and injustices are the faults neither of Zen in the East nor 
of nuclear physics in the West, but of our human cultures as wholes. It is, of 
course, quite understandable that Zen should be confused with a religion, that 
is, something of the same order as Christianity or Judaism. After all, it is a form 
of Buddhism, which is normally treated as a religion by many of its students 
and interpreters, inappropriately in my own view. (Shared by such other scholars 
as A. K. Coomaraswamy and Rene Guenon.) But Buddhism is a phenomenon 
with many levels and departments, reaching out with many different lines of 
inquiry. Zen is but one of these, and it happens to be concerned with the nature 
of man and the universe at a level which lies beyond good and evil. I see no 
way of denying the existence or validity of this level without absolutizing the 
standards of good and evil in some such form as the person of God. 

To conclude with three points of detail: (1) Dr. Fujisawa’s book, Zen and 
Shinto (1959), is about as representative of Zen as Edgar Guest of American 
poetry. (2) My own social philosophy has changed considerably since I wrote 
The Supreme Identity in 1949 [and published in 1950], and I have tried to express 
some part of it in the final chapter of Psychotherapy East and West, written in 
1960 [and published in 1961]. (3) Mr. Braun (1961) says that I have written “reams 
of pure unmitigated nonsense on the healthy sexual attitudes. . . . in the rustic 
paradise of the Asiatic village” (p. 180). I do not remember having written a 
single line, let alone reams, on the sexual life of the Asian village. In so far as 
I have discussed Asian sexual practices at all, I have been concerned with the 
rarely used and even quite esoteric sexual disciplines of Hindu and Buddhist 
Tantra. I wonder if Mr. Braun is really concerned with ethics.’

CHAPTER ELEVEN 


Prefatory Essay to Suzuki's 
Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism (1963) 


Ss . years ago, an eminent British scientist was discussing his 
theories with a friend in a London restaurant. A fascinated eaves- 
dropper at a nearby table, no longer able to contain herself, at last went over 
and said, “Excuse me, but I just couldn't help listening to your conversation, 
because the ideas you were discussing sounded exactly like Mahayana Bud- 
dhism!” The scientist avowed almost total ignorance of this subject and asked 
for the names of some books that would enlighten him. The lady gave him 
titles which included works by both Dr. Suzuki and myself, and thus it was that, 
in the course of the marvelous interconnectedness of all things, this scientist 
and I became friends. Oddly enough, one of his special interests is the problem 
of simultaneous discovery—as when two or more investigators working quite 
independently in different parts of the world, hit upon that same scientific 
invention. For something of the same kind happens when, in modern times, 
we unknowingly rediscover the ideas of ancient India and China. 

Indeed, there is an almost uncanny affinity between some of the major 
trends of modern Western thought and Buddhist philosophy. Bergson, Whitehead, 
Wittgenstein, Schrodinger, Dewey, Korzybski, Heidegger, Whyte, Tillich—all in 
some quite significant respects think like Buddhists. But why stress the point? 
Few of them, if any, began their work with a serious study of Eastern thought, 
even though the book in your hands [Suzuki’s Outlines] was first published in 
1907. Moreover, there is no sense in using this affinity as a pawn in the game 
of sectarian one-upmanship, as if to say, “See how up-to-date and scientific the 
Buddhists were in contrast to those superstitious Christians!” There is, perhaps,

156 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


a trace of such one-upmanship in this book, but it is understandable enough 
considering that Dr. Suzuki wrote it at a time when Eastern philosophy com- 
manded little of the intellectual respect which it enjoys today—thanks, in no small 
measure, to his own work. The importance of the parallels between Mahayana 
Buddhism and various trends in modern thought lies in a wholly constructive 
direction, which has nothing to do with any sort of sectarian propaganda for 
Buddhism. Indeed, a really serious student of the disciplines which Mahayana 
Buddhism involves would be simply dismayed by the propagation of Buddhism 
in the West as an organized religion. 

Although Dr. Suzuki speaks here of Buddhism as a religion, this is only in 
the most vague and general sense of the term. For the study of its disciplines 
has nothing to resemble the considerations which would influence one to be a 
Roman Catholic rather than a Baptist, or vice versa. The real concerns of Bud- 
dhism are closer to psychotherapy, or even to something such as ophthalmology, 
than to the choice between differing systems of belief which we recognize in 
the West as adopting a religion. A convert to Buddhism is as unimaginable as 
a convert to cookery, unless the conversion means simply that one has become 
a cook instead of a cobbler, or that one has become interested in cooking well. 
For Buddhism, whether Hinayana or Mahayana, is not a system of doctrines 
and commandments requiring our belief and obedience. It is a method (one of 
the exact meanings of dharma) for the correction of our perceptions and for the 
transformation of consciousness. It is so thoroughly experimental and empirical 
that the actual subject-matter of Buddhism must be said to be an immediate, 
nonverbal experience rather than a set of beliefs or ideas or rules of behavior. 

In sum, Buddhism is a method for changing one’s sense of identity, that 
is, of the way in which one experiences the fact of being alive. For it seems 
that, East and West, today as in 600 B.C., most people experience themselves as 
lonely and isolated selves or souls, minds or egos, confined within bags of skin. 
Both the external world of material events and the internal world of thought 
and feeling are realms which the self confronts as alien to and other than itself. 
The individual therefore experiences himself as something in, but not truly of, 
a universe which cares nothing for him, and in which he is a very imperma- 
nent fluke. Buddhism—in common with Vedanta and Yoga in India, and with 
Taoism in China—considers this sensation of separate identity a hallucination. 

The hallucination is an unhappy by-product of the high degree to which 
man has developed the power of conscious attention—the power of concentrat- 
ing awareness upon figures to the exclusion of their backgrounds, upon things 
and events to the exclusion of their environmental contexts. The penalty for 
this brilliant but circumscribed form of awareness is ignore-ance (avidya) of the 
ground that goes inseparably with the figure, of the context that goes with the 
event, and of the cosmic environment that goes with the individual organism. 
In short, an over-specialization in this mode of highly selective and exclusive 
consciousness gives man the illusion that he himself—his identity—is confined 


PREFATORY ESSAYS TO SUZUKI’S OUTLINES 157 


within his skin. But a proper correction of perception would show that “he” is 
as much the universe outside the skin as the system of organs within it. The 
behavior of the one is the behavior of the other, and the existence of the two 
is as interdependent, mutual, reciprocal, or correlative as that of front and back. 

Normal commonsense is almost a conspiracy to prevent people from seeing 
that this is true. Our languages, our habitual but learned modes of thought and 
perception, and our social conventions as a whole make it amazingly difficult 
to see and to feel the individual and the universe as one field, one system, and 
one process of activity—in short, as one Self. Man therefore regards the birth 
and death of individual organisms as the beginning and end of selves, not real- 
izing that they come and go like leaves upon a tree, and that the tree—so to 
say—is the actual self. But this realization requires an expansion and deepening 
of consciousness so that the narrow spotlight of normal attention discovers the 
origin from which it shines. 

The real content and work of Buddhism is, then, this very expansion 
of consciousness. And just this, rather than any set of concepts, is what it 
has to contribute to the development of modern thought. For, as we shall 
shortly see, Western philosophy and science have arrived at theoretical points 
of view remarkably close to those of Mahayana Buddhism. But for the most 
part those viewpoints remain theoretical: there is no actual and corresponding 
change in the state of consciousness, and, as a result, the individual knows 
things without feeling them. In other words, the scientist of the twentieth 
century knows in theory, from his study of ecology and biology, that he is an 
organism-environment field. But in practice he feels subjectively as if he were 
still in the sixteenth or second century, sensing himself as an organism merely 
in and confronting its environment. He has never felt the new identity which 
his theory suggests, and may even fear such an experience as some form of 
pathological and “regressive” mysticism. 

I want to review the main respects in which I feel that philosophical and 
scientific thought in this twentieth century runs parallel to Mahayana Bud- 
dhism. But it may, as a preliminary, be worth asking whether there has been 
any historical influence of the latter upon the former. The question is peculiarly 
difficult to decide, for, although reliable information about Buddhist philosophy 
has been available at least from the beginning of this century, it has not—until 
recently—been something in which the academic philosopher or scientist would 
admit a serious interest, unless, of course, he were an orientalist or philologist. 
His interest would then be purely formal, concentrating, as a rule, upon the 
literary and antiquarian aspects of Buddhism as distinct from its philosophical 
and experimental content. Nevertheless, there is evidence that a number of 
Western scholars have had a practical interest in these materials, which they 
were cautious in admitting to their colleagues. 

On the one hand, there was the traditional association of Buddhism with 
heathenish idolatry and with cultures which it was convenient for Western 


158 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


colonialism to define as backward and primitive. On the other hand, around 
the turn of the century Eastern philosophy was widely associated with various 
forms of Theosophy, and thus with the stress of the latter upon occult or psychic 
phenomena, which in no way commended it to the temper of scientific thought 
at that time. Yet from shortly before 1900 there has appeared a slowly increasing 
volume of work on Mahayana Buddhism, and other types of Eastern philosophy, 
that is both scholarly and sympathetic to the practical and experimental aspect 
of this philosophy. The present work [Suzuki’s Outlines] is one of the earliest 
examples of this trend, and, in comparison both with its author’s later works 
and with the general progress of Buddhist scholarship, the present-day reader 
may not at once appreciate what a remarkable achievement it is. 

So far as I can see, Dr. Suzuki was the first Asian, Buddhist or Hindu, 
to combine a fine mastery of English with a scholarly knowledge of his own 
philosophical tradition that was at once sound by Western standards and sym- 
pathetic to the subject, and then to write a systematic account of an Asian 
philosophy, the Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism. Searching the bibliographies, I 
find nothing comparable from an Asian hand at any earlier date.’ Suzuki was, 
then, the first great scholar-interpreter of the East to the West to come out 
of Asia, and it is marvelous to reflect that as I write this, in the summer of 
1963, he is still alive and vigorous, approaching the age of 94. His best known 
work did not appear until twenty years after the Outlines, for it was in 1927 
that he published the first volume of Essays in Zen Buddhism. It was shortly after 
this that James Bissett Pratt made the celebrated remark that there two kinds 
of cultured people: those who have read Suzuki and those who have not. It 
would have been pointless to say this unless a great many people of culture 
had indeed read him. Perhaps some literary detective will one day trace out 
the actual channels of Suzuki’s influence. It cannot have been negligible, but 
at the same time ideas have a way of being “in the air,” so that we catch them 
without knowing their source. 

What are, then, some of the dominant trends in Western scientific thought 
which are so closely akin to Mahayana Buddhism? First of all, there is relativity 
in its most general sense—the recognition that there is no universal truth that 
can be stated in any meaningful proposition. Everything that is so, is so for a 
particular observer or in relation to a particular situation. It is obviously impos- 
sible to speak simultaneously from or for all possible points of view. (The last 
two sentences may appear to be universal propositions, though actually they are 
no more than statements about observation and description.) There is thus no 
way of making any valid proposition about Reality, Being, or the nature of all 
things. This is the general consensus of modern analytical philosophy—logical 
positivism, scientific empiricism, or whatever it may be called. So far as it goes, 
this is also the Mahayanist doctrine of sunyata or “voidness,” which is not, as 
some have believed, the assertion that the universe does not really exist, but 
that all propositions or concepts about the universe are void and invalid. 


PREFATORY ESSAYS TO SUZUKI’S OUTLINES 159 


But unlike, say, logical positivism, the Mahayana does not rest its enquiry here 
and busy itself with logical trivia. It goes on to concern itself with a knowledge 
of the universal, of Reality, which is nonverbal. Sunyata has, as it were, a posi- 
tive aspect that is experienceable but unmentionable. This must be approached 
through a further meaning of the term, which is that in the real, nonverbal world 
there are neither things nor events. This is a point of view, which, in the modern 
West, is associated with various forms of semantics, and especially with the work 
of Korzybski, Sapir, Whorf, and, to some extent, the earlier Wittgenstein. For 
this work has made it clear that things and events are units, not of nature, but 
thought. Basically the thing or event is any area of space or span of time upon 
which attention may be focused. Thus to assimilate the world to our thinking 
we have to break it down into these manageable units. This is the way we apply 
the calculus to the measurement of curves, and also the way in which we ingest 
our food. Food has to be reduced to gulps or to bite-sized units. But as cows do 
not grow ready sliced, the natural universe does not exist ready thinged. This 
does not mean that the real world is a formless and unvaried mush. It exists 
just as we perceive it, but not necessarily as we conceive it. 

Therefore to conceive the world as a multiplicity of separate things is to 
ignore the basic unity that exists between widely distant bodies in space, just as 
it exists between the proportionately distant molecules of one’s own body. Our 
clumsy attempts to account for one event by others through the mysterious 
connections of causality, is simply a failure to see that the events so connected 
actually constitute a single event, and that this in turn (looking at it one way) 
makes up, or (looking at it another) expresses The Event, which Mahayanists 
call the Dharmakaya, the Body of Being. 

Part of the discipline of Buddhism is therefore the cultivation of intellectual 
silence, for certain periods of time. This is to be aware of whatever happens 
to be, without thinking about it, without forming words and symbols in the 
mind. The world is then seen in its fundamental state of tathata, for which 
English has only the awkward equivalent of “thusness” or “suchness.” But it 
represents what Korzybski called the “unspeakable,” that is, the nonverbal level 
of reality. The point of the Buddhist discipline is to see that life is, in itself, 
quite unproblematic. There are such specific problems as how to build a bridge 
or put out a fire, but there is no Problem of Being unless one creates it for 
oneself out of nothing. For, as Wittgenstein saw, we manufacture the Problem 
of Life by asking questions or making demands upon ourselves or others which 
are meaningless or self-contradictory. We make a complex game out of the 
world by setting values upon nature’s chips, and then confuse the game with 
the world itself. In Wittgenstein’s (1922/1960) own words: 


The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world every- 
thing is as it is and happens as it does. In it there is no value—and if 
there were, it would be of no value. 


160 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happen- 
ing and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental. (6:41) 


The Mahayanist would go on to point out that realizing that there is no 
value in the world does not mean that it is valueless, for this word, as we 
use it, implies the negative value-judgment that the world is chaotic, absurd, 
meaningless, and so forth. Tathata, suchness, is simply the world as beyond 
valuation, whether positive or negative. At this level, the world is also accidental 
in the sense of such terms as svayambhu (self-existent, becoming so of itself) 
or the Chinese Tzu-jan (spontaneous, of itself so, nature, natural). The English 
“accidental” has the misleading sense of something happening at random in a 
world that is supposed to be orderly. 

Sunyata and tathata are therefore basic and complementary terms. Sunyata 
means that all such terms as eternal or temporal, one or many, real or unreal, 
being or nonbeing, good or bad, are inapplicable to the world as a whole. Each 
of these words has meaning only in terms of its opposite, or of some contrast. 
But there is nothing outside the whole with which to contrast it. Thought is 
really a system of classification, of sorting experiences into intellectual boxes. 
Every class, every box must have both inside and outside, but the world as a 
whole has no outside and therefore no inside: it is in no class. Sunyata means, 
further, that the world is not actually divided into, or composed of, separate 
things and events. For very division is also a union, an interdependence. The 
figure stands out sharply against the background, but without the background 
the figure is not manifest. Sunyata is the exhaustion of thought in its attempt to 
grasp existence. But when thought relaxes its hold, the world is, not conceived 
but experienced, as tathata. That is to say, all that happens seems to be self- 
explanatory, self-sufficient, and complete just by happening. Yet in such a way 
that one doesn’t say, “So what?” but, “My God!” Or, “Well, Pll be damned!” 

One of the profoundest insights of Mahayana Buddhism has its modern 
counterpart in the transactionalism of John Dewey, and in the organismic phi- 
losophy of Whitehead, and of the biologists von Bertelannfy, Goldstein, and 
Woodger.’ Suzuki wrote his Outlines before he had begun his exhaustive study 
of a text known as the Avatamsaka Sutra, a text that represents the high point 
of Mahayanist philosophy. The central theme of the Avatamsaka is what is 
known as the dharmadhatu theory of the mutual interpenetration of all things 
and events. Dr. Takakusu (1947) expressed it as follows: 


Buddhism holds that nothing was created singly or individually. All 
things in the universe—matter and mind—arose simultaneously, all 
things in it depending upon one another, the influence of each mutually 
permeating and thereby making a universal symphony of harmonious 
totality. If one item were lacking, the universe would not be complete; 
without the rest, one item cannot be. (p. 40) 


PREFATORY ESSAYS TO SUZUKI’S OUTLINES 161 


The word “simultaneously” in the above passage is perhaps not quite hap- 
pily chosen. Everything in the universe has not come into being at the same 
time. The idea is rather that all events, past, present, and future, here and 
elsewhere, are mutually interdependent. The earlier event A does not occur 
unless the latter event B is assured, just as an electric current does not depart 
from the positive terminal until the negative terminal is connected. A departure 
requires a point of arrival. Furthermore, although event A may be defined as 
having ceased before event B begins, the occurrence of B will depend upon A 
having happened. It is in this way that all depends upon each, and continues 
to do so even when the individual event has vanished. A universe in which, 
say, Socrates did not, or could not, exist would not be this kind of universe. 

The Avatamsaka likens the cosmos to a many-dimensioned network of gems, 
in which each contains the reflection of all the others—ad infinitum. Any one 
implies all the rest, because all project themselves into each. Many people have 
some intellectual difficulty in grasping this kind of reciprocal or polar relation- 
ship, even though the principle is as simple as two sticks supporting each other 
in the form of an inverted V: the one does not stand without the other. This is 
in some respects remarkably close to Dewey’s theory (Dewey & Bentley, 1954) 
of the transactional nature of the relationship between the individual and the 
world. The term transaction is chosen in preference to interaction or reaction 
because of its stress upon the mutuality of the relationship. In the transaction 
of buying and selling, the two operations go to together: there is no buying 
without selling, or selling without buying. 

Thus a living, individual organism is not only part of the world, but it 
goes with a world of just this nature, as apples go only with apple trees. But, 
conversely, this kind of a world—a world of light and sound, weight and 
texture—is what it is in terms of our organic structure. Only eyes can evoke 
light from the sun. It appears, then, that as the organism is something in the 
world, the world is at the same time something in the organism, since light 
and sound, shape and substance, are states of the organism. 

This is further clarified by the biologists and ecologists who see, no longer 
organisms in environments, but organism-environments which are unified fields 
of behavior. In describing the behavior of any organism, the biologist soon finds 
that he is also describing the behavior of the environment. He realizes, then, 
that he must talk in terms of a new entity—the organism-environment. This has 
the interesting consequence that attributes which have formerly been ascribed 
to the organism alone—intelligence in particular—must also be ascribed to the 
environment. It is for this reason that biologists now speak of the evolution of 
environments as well as that of organisms, for a given organism will arise only 
in an environment that is sufficiently developed to maintain it. 

This sort of thing was difficult to see so long as science was set on explaining 
things by a purely analytical method—that is, by trying to account for the larger 
units of the world by studying the structure of the smaller units that “compose” 


162 BUDDHISM AND ZEN 


them. (Note the transitive verb.) This approach had the indispensable merit of 
giving us a clear picture of the whole structure, but it led to the illusion that 
the smaller units, such as cells or molecules, were in some way responsible or 
causative of the larger, of organisms. But, as von Bertelannfy (1960) showed 
so clearly, what a cell is and does depends upon the kind of system or context 
in which it is found. Blood in a test-tube is not the same thing as blood in the 
veins, because, for one thing, it is behaving differently. 

Insights of these kinds have been enormously helped by the recognition 
that in science one speaks, not so much of what things are as of what they 
do. The world is described as behavior or process, so that what was formerly 
“thing” is now simply “event.” One no longer asks what (thing) is behaving in 
such-and-such a way; one simply describes the behavior and says where it is 
happening. In other words, action does not have to be ascribed to an agent 
defined as something quite different from action. The agent, too, can be suf- 
ficiently described as action. This is precisely the Buddhist anatman doctrine 
that deeds (karma) exist but no doers, that human behavior is not propelled 
by a subjective soul or ego. 

Thus as Western science approaches a view of the world as a unified field 
of behavior, it approaches an idea of the Dharmakaya, the Universal Body 
(Organism), or of the Dharmadhatu, the Universal Field. But only the idea. The 
empirical approach of Western science should be sympathetic to the principle 
that hypothesis must be followed by experiment and observation. If, therefore, 
the hypothesis that man is organism-environment, individual-universe, is to be 
translated into experience, what is to be done? Obviously, the individual must 
find out how or what he is prior to and behind all ideas and images of him- 
self. He must somehow strip off his masks, his identification of himself with 
stereotypes and roles, and find out what he is existentially, or, as Buddhists 
would say, what he is in the domain of “suchness.” 

When Buddhism is called the dharma, the word has the meaning of method 
rather than doctrine. For, speaking very strictly, there are no Buddhist doctrines. 
The method is essentially a dialogue between a Buddha, a person who is awak- 
ened to his real identity, and an ordinary individual, who experiences himself as 
a separate being. The dialogue begins when the latter raises a question, which 
may be as radical and simple as how to escape from suffering. What happens 
then is that the teacher (though the Asian idea of a guru is not really what 
we mean by a teacher) proposes an experiment. He does not give an answer, 
but rather suggests something that the enquirer might do to test the grounds 
upon which he bases his problem. He may suggest that since suffering is the 
consequence of desire, the solution is to eliminate desire, and then send the 
enquirer away to try that. Thus what appear to be the doctrines of Buddhism, 
as that the origin of suffering is desire or craving, are in fact only the opening 
stages of a dialogue (involving also a series of experiments)—a dialogue that 
may conclude in a way that is hardly foreshadowed at the beginning. 


PREFATORY ESSAYS TO SUZUKI’S OUTLINES 163 


The essential principle of the dialogue is the application of sunyata—that 
is, to let the enquirer find out that nothing that he can do, or refrain from 
doing, think, or refrain from thinking, will answer his question. For his ques- 
tion is based upon the false assumption that “he” is something separate from 
all that he experiences, something to which the universe happens, something 
that confronts, but is not, everything else in the world. The aim of the teacher 
is to show that this separate “experiencer” of the world is fictitious; that it can 
neither do nor not do, and that all stratagems of thought designed to grasp the 
world to the satisfaction of the experiencer are futile. In short, the dialogue, 
and the experiments in meditation and thought-control that go along with it, 
is constructed to bring the enquirer to a complete impasse. He comes to the 
point of finding all his philosophical and metaphysical notions absurd, all his 
motivations the wrong ones, and of being in a situation where he has nothing 
left to grasp for spiritual or psychological security. 

At this point he has no alternative but to let go, or rather, a letting go 
comes about through the whole of his being, since it is an action no longer 
attributed to the ego as agent. He is, as it were, thrown into sunyata like a per- 
son falling, for the first time, into water, into the ocean of relativity. Because, 
in water, there is nothing to be grasped, the rule of floating is to let go—and 
then the water bears one up. 

Analogously, at this moment sunyata is experienced in a peculiarly positive 
way, for which Mahayana philosophy supplies no clear theoretical basis, no real 
explanation of why it happens. Almost invariably, with this full letting go, the 
individual finds himself deeply in love with the world. As the sutras say, there 
is aroused within him a great compassionate heart. It turns out that although 
the Dharmakaya is always described in negative terms that make it sound 
entirely abstract and arid, the real experiential Dharmakaya is quite otherwise. 
Whatever it may be in itself, when realized in human experience it becomes 
the force of karuna—the compassion of one who knows that, in some way, 
all suffering is his own suffering, and all “sentient beings” the disguises of his 
own inmost nature. It is in these final steps that Mahayana Buddhism may have 
some contribution for Western culture.

competitor for this honor would be Swami Vivekananda, but his approach was avowedly 
that of preacher and popularizer rather than scholar. Bunyu Nanjio and Junjiro Takakusu, 
both eminent scholars, published work in English before 1900, but in the form of cata- 
logues and articles on minutiae. The next work by an Asian, comparable to Suzuki's, 
seems to be Sogen Yamakami’s (1912) Systems of Buddhistic Thought.

on Mystical Theology, Together with the 
First and Fifth Epistles (1944) 


INTRODUCTION' 


he relation of God to the world must be considered in two ways. 

On the one hand, God is revealed in the world—in the divine 
humanity of Jesus Christ, in the faculties and virtues of the human soul and 
mind, in the beauty and power of the natural universe. On the other hand, 
God is infinitely greater than the world, and so differs from it in kind and 
degree that no creaturely image or form can possibly give any true idea of His 
greatness, His holiness and His essential Self. God reveals Himself to us, and 
yet remains infinitely mysterious. He is something like things that we know, 
like a Father, like the humanity of Jesus, and yet, in Himself, He is quite other 
than the things we know and experience. He is as different, much more differ- 
ent, from the world as color is different from shape. A circle is different from 
a square, a beautiful shape from an ugly shape, only in degree; but the color 
red is different from the shape circle in kind, and as no color can be described 
in terms of shape, the essential Being of God cannot be described in terms 
of any created thing. We can form rather less of a true idea of God’s essence 
than a man born blind can form a true picture of a radiant sunrise. 

By itself this truth might lead us to wrong conclusions, for it is equally 
true that we are given a correct idea of God’s nature in Jesus Christ. Yet this 
is as if someone tried to reveal the beauty of color to a blind man by means 
of beautiful sound. Jesus is, as it were, the glorious sound of God’s light; for

the sound and the light (or color) have in common the quality of beauty. God 
and the humanity of Jesus have in common the qualities of perfect goodness, 
holiness and love, and as we might represent the beauty of the sunrise to the 
blind man by beautiful music, so God represents to us the beauty of His tran- 
scendent nature by the beauty of His Incarnate Word. Though the blind man 
cannot realize what the sunrise actually looks like, he can know positively and 
surely that it is incomparably beautiful. 

These two truths underlie the mystical theology of St. Dionysius the pseudo- 
Areopagite, which is at the root of the whole Catholic tradition of contemplative 
prayer.’ He teaches that there are two ways of knowing God, one according to 
the way He reveals Himself in the world, and the other according to the way in 
which He is infinitely other than the world. The first is the subject of his book 
The Divine Names, and the second of his Mystical Theology. Obviously the second 
way is much more difficult, but he maintains that in the end it leads to a truer 
understanding than the first because it is the way of contemplative prayer in 
which the soul rises above all creatures to the pure knowledge of God. But we 
must begin the spiritual life by the first way, for we require revelation, positive 
knowledge of God’s nature and will, mediated to us in terms of human life. 
Such revelation is neither false nor misleading, but necessarily incomplete, for 
which reason the deepest knowledge of God that may be granted us in this 
life must be in other than creaturely terms. 

His Mystical Theology is therefore based on the principle of God’s transcen- 
dence. God as the Maker of all things, all virtues, all ideas, is preeminently 
greater and other than what He has made, and to know God one must seek 
Him ultimately in a realm beyond all kinds of ordinary knowledge, whether 
it be knowledge of the senses, of the mind, or of the feelings. For God who 
is the Author of sense, mind and feeling can neither be touched, known nor 
felt. Whatever may be touched, known or felt is a creature and not God. God 
and His creation are absolutely incommensurable, in somewhat the same way 
as shape and color. 

At first sight this might seem to be saying that between God as He is in 
Himself and His creation there is an impassable gulf, and that to know God as 
He is one must not only look for no information from ordinary knowledge but 
even get rid of ordinary knowledge. Some have tried to understand Dionysius in 
this way, as if he advised us to seek God through violent extermination of the 
activity of the senses and the intellect, as if God and the world were not only 
incommensurable but radically incompatible. According to this view, knowledge 
of God and knowledge of the world cannot exist together; to know God one 
must blot out all consciousness of creatures. 

But this is an entirely false interpretation of his theology. Nowhere does 
he teach the Gnostic heresy that God and His creation are incompatible; for 
the whole theme of the Divine Names is the compatibility of the two. The 
analogy of color and shape will again help us to clarify his ideas, for color 


THEOLOGICA MYSTICA 169 


and shape are certainly not compatible, save in the sense that an ugly shape is 
incompatible with a beautiful color. Thus the world is incompatible with God 
only as disfigured by sin. But just because shape and color are incommensu- 
rable they can be perfectly united. We cannot unite perfectly a square and a 
circle, and in the same way there could be no perfect union of God and man 
if God belonged to the same order of being as man, if He were greater than 
man only in degree. But as there can be perfect union between the color red 
and a circle, God and the world can be united without conflict while remain- 
ing essentially different. Therefore God’s transcendence, so far from removing 
Him from the world, is just what makes it possible for Him to be intimately 
present in it without any loss of His absolute supremacy and holiness. For God 
can be present in the world yet never limited or contaminated by it, much as 
the purity and intensity of a color can never be lessened by its presence in an 
ugly shape. The shape could writhe and contort itself for ever, and yet have 
not the slightest power over its color. 

Our first knowledge of God is through earthly and creaturely things that 
are something like Him, but those who are called to the mystical life are never 
content with this kind of knowledge. They want God Himself, not some 
creature like God. At first, therefore, they try to capture Him in some form. 
Such a form may be an idea about God, for we find that we are assured of 
His presence by thinking of the various doctrines of the Church concerning 
His nature. For a time this satisfies, but after a while we find that we are using 
the doctrine to catch hold of God and make Him as it were our own property. 
And, then, because He wants us to know Him more deeply, He makes this 
way of knowing His presence not untrue but inadequate. He slips from our 
grasp. Or again, the form in which we try to possess Him may be some state 
of mind or feeling. We may have some minor order of mystical experience and 
try to work ourselves up into the same experience again and again, imagining 
that we can possess a sense of God by pressing the right psychological button. 

But as we persevere in these attempts to hold God in some form, whether 
a sensible image or state of mind, we learn that in truth we cannot possess 
God at all. “What,” asked von Hugel, “is a sense of God worth which would 
be at your disposal, capable of being comfortably elicited when and where 
you please? It is far, far more God who must hold us, than we who must hold 
Him. And we get trained in these darknesses into that sense of our impotence 
without which the very presence of God becomes a snare.” Such attempts to 
capture the sense of God in some form are much like trying to catch the wind 
in a bag; what can be caught is not the wind but only stagnant air, for the God 
who is a Spirit can never be held. It is He that must hold us, bearing us up in 
His Spirit like leaves upon the wind. 

All men seek God, even though they may not know it. They seek Him 
blindly as wealth, power or material happiness; going higher than this, they seek 
Him in the strict performance of a moral law, in some feeling of spiritual elation, 


170 CHRISTIANITY 


or some sensation of a mighty Presence. But all these things Dionysius shows 
to be creatures of God and not God Himself. Those called to the higher stages 
of the spiritual life must pass beyond them, resolutely setting aside everything 
that can be known or felt, saying, “This is not yet God.” But this does not mean 
that the contemplative must utterly cease to know and feel in the ordinary way; 
it means that he must cease to identify anything that he knows or feels with 
God. He goes on with his daily work and with his normal Christian duties, but 
he tries to maintain at all times a loving faith in the immediate presence of the 
God whom he can neither feel, see nor know. He walks through a darkness so 
far as his comprehension of God is concerned, knowing God as That which he 
does not know—as a glorious mystery. 

This is no mere agnosticism, for the Unknowable Reality of the agnostic 
is not an object of faith and love. Mystery for the agnostic is mere absence of 
knowledge, but for the contemplative it has a tremendous attractive power. It 
draws him into itself like a vacuum, and he reaches out into this void in the 
simple faith that it is a void only to his human faculties, and in reality is filled 
with the living God. In one way this is a hard, arid and costly task, for he has to 
devote his whole life and being to the love of what seems to be a void, though 
by faith he knows that it is the hiding-place of the Most High. 

But there are compensations, and at the last a great reward. For he under- 
stands that the presence of God does not depend on his willing, knowing or 
feeling it. He sees that God’s presence is given quite apart from any effort he 
may make to feel it. To try to feel this given presence is to ignore the truth 
that God is here and now in all His fullness. It is like a bird flying in search 
of the air. But as a bird can fly up or down, left or right, because it is in the 
air and has no need to find it, so we can give ourselves entirely and joyfully 
to the work of each moment, whether it be chopping wood or praising God, 
because we and all that we do are in God. For it is through rejoicing in His 
possession of us, and not in trying to possess Him, that we come to a true 
knowledge of God. 

Thus the contemplative begins to have a true awareness of God not by 
seeking Him as yet another form of experience, but by accepting His presence 
as given like an invisible color in every shape of experience. He can thus devote 
himself wholeheartedly to his work in the simple faith that God is as much 
with him when he is not specifically thinking about God as when he is. God, 
he finds, is as present with him as the present moment; he may be thinking 
of past or future events but he can never escape from the present moment, 
which seems to carry him along with itself even when his thoughts are not 
immediately concerned with it. God is with us and carries us forward through 
our lives in rather the same way, for as it is said in Psalm 139: 


Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from Thy 
presence? If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there: if I make my 


THEOLOGICA MYSTICA 171 


bed in hell, behold, Thou art there. If I take the wings of the morn- 
ing, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall Thy 
hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the 
darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me. Yea, 
the darkness hideth not from Thee; but the night shineth as the day: 
the darkness and the light are both alike to Thee. 


“The night shineth as the day.” This is the seeming paradox upon which 
Dionysius loves to dwell, for he speaks of the contemplative state as the “divine 
darkness,” a darkness of the spirit that Christian mystics have always associ- 
ated with that mysterious cry from the Cross, “My God, my God, why hast 
Thou forsaken me?” This darkness is the climax of the Purgative Way, which 
is less a preliminary stage of the mystical life to be passed and left behind than 
the constant and primary condition of mystical prayer. We are always in the 
Purgative Way, and in this life never outgrow the need either for the forgive- 
ness of sins or for the purification of our knowledge of God. In purifying our 
knowledge of God we come to the point where He seems, to all knowledge 
and sense, to have forsaken us utterly. For we have purified that knowledge of 
every attempt to grasp God in sensible and intellectual forms, so that there 
is nothing left to know in any ordinary sense of the word, save what may be 
known by simple faith in the truths that God has revealed about Himself. This 
darkness is as far as Dionysius takes us, for words can go no further except 
to say with him that the divine darkness “overfills our unseeing minds with 
splendors of transcendent beauty.” After purgation comes illumination, for God 
takes possession of the soul when all its faculties are surrendered to Him, and 
no longer strive to make Him their own property. 

The apparent paradox of a night that shines as the day is unthinkable with- 
out belief in a living God who acts and exists independently of our knowledge 
of Him. People of timid faith feel subconsciously that apart from some image 
of God in their minds there might be no God at all. Their God tends to be 
subjective and even idolatrous for they are putting faith in a mental or emotional 
image of their own making. They dare not reach out into the void beyond such 
images and feelings, fearing that God might not after all be there. Some such 
fear haunts almost all of us, for which reason, while it may sound simple, the 
complete abandonment of ourselves to this divine darkness is no easy matter. It 
means the abandonment of ultimate faith in all creatures whatsoever, whether 
they are objective people and things or subjective thoughts and feelings. 

Some people regard this quest for knowledge of God in the divine darkness 
as a “tragic accident of Christian thought,” a way of pure negation that denies 
all interest in creative life, fitted only for hermits who have a dismal delight in 
contemplating mere emptiness. But Dionysius’s mysticism is negative only in 
the sense that the Cross and sacrificial death is negative. For this negative way 
of prayer is based on implicit trust in the existence of a positively excellent and 


172 CHRISTIANITY 


glorious God who is only negative in so far as His glory cannot be described 
directly in any human terms. The divine darkness is a spiritual death out of 
which comes a resplendent life, because through dying to himself the individual 
is taken over and lived by God. He returns to the creative work of living and 
attends to it with the power of God in his body and soul, for “I live; yet no 
longer I, but Christ liveth in me.” 

The divine darkness can seem a negative and dismal goal only when there 
is lack of faith in the objective though invisible reality of a God who will mys- 
teriously emerge from that darkness and fire the mystic with His own creative 
life. To the doubting mind it may seem incredible that the glory of God can 
come out of such emptiness. But it can for the simple reason that this glory is 
not of our own making, and that God will give it to those who do not try to 
substitute for it the visions of their own imaginations. Truly, “the desert shall 
rejoice and blossom as the rose.” This negative way of Dionysian mysticism 
is, then, the central Christian mystery of “as dying, and, behold, we live.” It 
is like the chrysalis tomb, passing through which the grub becomes gloriously 
winged. For the mystical life follows the primal Christian pattern of Him who 
was crucified, dead and buried, yet rose again in a transfigured body, full of 
the glory of God. 

According to St. Dionysius, contemplation is that high order of prayer in 
which the soul draws near to the very essence of God in a divine darkness, which 
neither sense, thought nor feeling can penetrate. The power so to outdistance 
our own faculties of perception in the approach to God is only given to those 
whom God calls. While the possession of such a vocation is not necessarily a 
sign of great holiness, the very nature of the contemplative work demands that 
complete dedication of the self to God in which holiness consists. Others who 
have not this vocation and know little or nothing of mystical prayer may arrive 
at a holiness as great as that of the mystic in a purely active life of service and 
charity. We cannot say how many souls are called to the contemplative work; 
but not all souls are called, for which reason those who are able to use this 
order of prayer must not despise or belittle the other and more ordinary ways 
of prayer, or consider themselves more holy than those who cannot use it. For 
the ways to God are as many as the lives of men. 

No infallible rules can be laid down for determining whether or not a soul 
is called to this prayer, but those who feel drawn to it would do well to consult 
an experienced director and watch out for certain temptations. Contemplatives 
are sometimes accused of being lazy people who like to sit and think about 
nothing, and a false idea of the contemplative work may indeed attract those 
who simply cannot be bothered with the more formal disciplines of prayer 
and meditation. The work of contemplation may also attract those who wish 
to pride themselves upon their spiritual superiority, since mystical writers are 
accustomed to speak of it as a “high” and “sublime” type of prayer. Such a 


THEOLOGICA MYSTICA 173 


motive simply nullifies the work. Yet only rarely is a soul free from this kind 
of pride, for which reason those drawn to contemplation must, of all people, 
constantly search for it in themselves and lay it before God for His forgiveness. 

Contemplation is advisedly called a work, for it is no mere basking in the 
light of vague aspirations and “lofty” sentiments; it is rather a journey through 
a desert, bereft of most of the emotional and intellectual consolations of other 
kinds of prayer. It is a work because it requires a much greater degree of 
concentration, for the will has to leave behind the convenient props of verbal 
prayer and discursive meditation, and direct itself into the divine darkness with 
a single act of love and faith. Thus it should not be undertaken unless the soul 
feels positively and genuinely unable to use these other forms of prayer with 
spiritual benefit. 

Strictly speaking, contemplative prayer is prayer of the will. For if we 
say that the human soul has the four faculties of sensation, intellect, feeling 
and will, vocal prayer, in which we use the sensible forms of definite words 
or such external aids as the rosary, is prayer through the faculty of sensation. 
This is usually the easiest form of prayer for the beginner. Next we rise to 
mental prayer, or discursive meditation, which is prayer through the faculty 
of the intellect, in which we ponder various divine truths or images in the 
thinking mind. Following this, the faculty of feeling comes into play as affec- 
tive prayer, in which we feel about those truths rather than think about them. 
Instead of thinking love toward God, we feel love toward Him, and this feeling 
may express itself in short ejaculatory sentences or phrases of adoration and 
praise. But at last the diverse sensations of vocal prayer, the diverse thoughts 
of mental prayer, and the diverse feelings of affective prayer become a single 
and simplified act of the will, as if many shapes and colors were merged into 
a pure white light. For the will is the central and all-determining faculty of 
the soul, and in contemplative prayer we simply will toward God. For God is 
no longer conceived in the form of an image arousing sensations, thoughts or 
feelings; God is now known as One who can neither be sensed, thought nor 
felt; He is a mystery, a divine darkness, to be loved in faith by a pure act of 
will. Only the will can approach a God who is no longer to be conceived in 
some creaturely form about which we can have sensations, thoughts and feel- 
ings. All these lesser faculties find the divine darkness a total void that renders 
them impotent. But the will can reach out into that darkness, moved by the 
simple faith that the transcendent, infinitely loveable God is there by virtue of 
His own power, which is wholly independent of our thinking and knowing. 

Thus contemplative prayer begins with what is sometimes called the 
“prayer of quiet” or the “prayer of simple regard,” the latter term qualifying 
the former and showing us that contemplation is not a state of pure quiescence. 
The term “prayer of quiet” refers to the quiescence of the sensations, thoughts 
and feelings, but the term “simple regard” refers to an intense activity in that 


174 CHRISTIANITY 


center of consciousness, which underlies these three faculties. But this activity 
is not diversified. In sensing, thinking and feeling our psychological activity is 
relatively complex, embracing a diversity of objects, impressions or ideas. The 
light-beam of consciousness is diffused and moves from one object, or part of 
an object, to another. In the pure willing of contemplation the beam is less 
diffused, more intensified, and is brought to rest upon a single point. Activity 
ceases only in regard to the movement of the beam, but not in regard to the 
intensity of light. 

It is particularly important to remember this principle because one of the 
great dangers attending this work is the temptation to pure quietism and a 
wholly negative and abstract view of God. Quietism may take one or both of 
two forms. It may be the notion that in prayer the soul should be completely 
inactive, abandoning even the direction of the will to God in love and faith. It 
may also be the notion that the contemplative should refrain as far as possible 
from every kind of active work, even the fulfillment of charitable duties and 
the active disciplines of the religious life. Now there are times when contempla- 
tion seems to involve a complete passivity of will, but this passivity is apparent 
only. The will has been utterly taken over by the will of God and experiences 
a great peace. Yet the sense of ease and peace is the result, not of complete 
inaction, but of acting with the will of God that bears up the soul like a mighty 
stream. As to the avoidance of charitable and religious duties, it must never be 
forgotten that God gives us His power, grace and love to be used both bodily 
and spiritually. We are to worship Him in act as well as in thought, and to 
love our brethren in both act and thought, for “if we love one another, God 
dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us” (I John 4:12). 

Quietism, which makes peace an end in itself, is generally associated with 
a passive and negative conception of God, sometimes fostered by thinking of 
Him too much in philosophical and abstract terms. The philosophical theolo- 
gians speak of God as pure Being or as the unmoved Mover, but this should 
not give us the impression that God is in a state of blissful inertia, passively 
awaiting our discovery. God is unmoved in the sense that no other person or 
principle moves Him; He is absolutely selfsmoved. Nor does He rest inertly and 
merely await discovery like so much buried treasure. He reveals Himself; He 
acts; He gives Himself to us; ourselves and all the universe are a part of His 
activity, for we are something that God is doing. The faith that God acts quite 
independently of us is essential for the spiritual life, for it is by this faith that 
we are able to recognize His presence as given, quite apart from our efforts to 
become aware of it. By this faith also we are able to know that the power and 
love of god bears us up in spite of ourselves, even before we begin to abandon 
ourselves to Him. It is this faith that prevents the conceit that in contemplation, 
in seeking union with God, we are doing all the work, for in fact we are really 
giving the entire assent of our wills to something that God has already done. 


THEOLOGICA MYSTICA 175 


We give ourselves to God, not forgetting, however, that we already belong to 
Him entirely and that in this sense our selves are not ours to give Him. The 
realization of our absolute dependence upon God is perhaps the most helpful 
factor in abandoning our lives to His will, for it tells us that we have nothing 
to lose save a purely imaginary self-sufficiency. To try to be self-sufficient apart 
from God is like pretending that we are held to the earth by our own strength 
and not by the force of gravity. 

This is not the place to discuss the more technical details of contemplative 
prayer, which must always be treated at some length because they will vary 
according to different people. It will therefore be necessary to consult such 
works of the masters of contemplative prayer in the Dionysian tradition as the 
Cloud of Unknowing, Fr. Augustine Baker’s Holy Wisdom, Walter Hilton’s Scale of 
Perfection, and St. John of the Cross’s Dark Night of the Soul and Ascent of Mount 
Carmel.’ Even in these works the technical suggestions are not of so precise a 
nature as would be expected, for instance, in a textbook of music or even in 
a manual of ascetic theology. For the art of contemplative prayer cannot be 
compressed into formulae or communicated in exact prescriptions, which when 
fulfilled will lead inevitably to the desired result. Generally speaking, the instruc- 
tions to be given are of extreme simplicity, but there is the greatest variation 
of their application to individual souls, while the work itself is naturally almost 
as difficult as the instructions are simple. 

The reader will find that most of these works have a deceptive somber- 
ness, for the authors approach their subject with gravity and caution, and give 
frequent warnings of the crosses that the contemplative must bear. They are 
wise, for they do not want to encourage souls to enter the work foolhardily. It 
should be said, however, that this apparent somberness conceals a divine gaiety 
of spirit such as one will find in the lives of St. Teresa and St. Francis, for their 
faith penetrates beyond the darkness to the music, the love and the laughter of 
heaven whither “the Lord is gone up with a merry noise.” “If,” said Coventry 
Patmore, “we may credit certain hints contained in the lives of the saints, love 
raises the spirit above the sphere of reverence and worship into one of laughter 
and dalliance: a sphere in which the soul says:—Shall I, a gnat which dances in 
Thy ray, dare to be reverent?” (cited in Underhill, 1930, p. 438). 

Here is all the holy frivolity of those who have ceased to be burdened with 
the seriousness of themselves. In the knowledge of their entire and inescap- 
able dependence upon God, they abandon themselves to Him without reserve, 
finding that herein is the only true security and freedom. And loosed from the 
anxieties and cares of the world, their inward spirit is as jubilant as a bird soar- 
ing and circling in the vastness of the sky. But their sky is not far above them 
in space, nor does the solid earth give it any downward limit, for those who 
have faith in the omnipresent, inescapable God find heaven upon earth, and, 
in the soul’s dark night and death to self, perpetual light and everlasting life. 


176 CHRISTIANITY 


ON MYSTICAL THEOLOGY: 
THE TREATISE OF ST. DIONYSIUS TO TIMOTHY* 


I. OF THE DIvINE DARKNESS. 


1. Thou Trinity beyond being,’ thou Godhead and most perfect Guardian of 
the divine wisdom of Christians, direct us to the height of mystical revela- 
tion, sublime beyond all thought and light; wherein the simple, absolute and 
immutable mysteries of Divine Truth are hidden in the translucent darkness 
of that silence that revealeth in secret. For this darkness, though of deepest 
obscurity, is yet radiantly clear, and, though beyond touch and sight, it overfills 
our unseeing minds with splendors of transcendent beauty. 

This is my prayer. As for you, beloved Timothy, exerting yourself sincerely 
in mystical contemplation, quit the senses, the workings of the intellect, and all 
that may be sensed and known, and all that is not and is.° For by this you may 
unknowingly’ attain, in as far as it is possible, to the one-ness of Him who is 
beyond all being and knowledge. Thus through indomitable, absolute and pure 
detachment of yourself from all things, you will be lifted up to that radiance 
of the divine darkness that is beyond being, surpassing all and free from all. 

2. But take heed lest the profane hear—those, I say, who cling to creatures, 
and imagine in themselves that nothing is beyond being, beyond existences, but 
suppose themselves to know Him “who maketh darkness His hiding-place.”* If, 
then, the divine mysteries are beyond such, what shall be said of those yet more 
profane who conceive the underlying Cause of all in terms of the outward 
forms of things,’ and assert that He exceeds not these impious and manifold 
conceits of their own making? In so far as He is the Cause of all things, we 
must needs impute and affirm of Him all their attributes; but in so far as He 
is beyond and above all, we must needs deny those attributes to Him entirely, 
yet not suppose that this affirmation and denial are contradictory, but that He 
Himself is before and above all denials, and beyond all negating and imputing."° 

3. After this manner, then, the blessed Bartholomew says that Divine 
Truth is both much and very little, and the Gospel both wide and great, and 
yet brief. This seems to me a marvelous insight, for the excellent Cause of all 
things may be revealed with many words, with few words, and with even no 
words, inasmuch as He is both unutterable and unknowable, because beyond 
being He stands above all nature. He is truly revealed without coverings only to 
those who pass above all things impure and pure, who go beyond all climbing 
of sacred heights, and leave behind all heavenly lights and sounds, and supernal 
discourses,’ and are taken up into that darkness where, as the Scripture says, He 
truly is who is beyond all things. For not unmeaningly was the blessed Moses 
himself first bidden to be purified; and after entire purification he heard the 
many-voiced trumpets, and beheld a multitude of lights, giving forth pure and 
manifold beams. After he was set aside from the manyfolk, he went before the 
elect priests to the uttermost peak of sacred heights.'” 


THEOLOGICA MYSTICA 177 


But thus far he had not yet converse with God Himself, nor beheld Him, 
for He is without aspect, but saw only the place where He dwells.’? This I take 
to mean that the most heavenly and lofty of things, which may be seen and 
known are no more than certain images of things subordinate to Him who 
transcends all. Through them is shown His presence, exceeding all comprehen- 
sion, standing on those heights of His holy places, which may be known of 
the mind. And at times he who is set free of things seen and of things seeing, 
enters into the truly mystical darkness of unknowing, wherefrom he puts out 
all intellectual knowledge, and cleaves to that which is quite beyond touch and 
sight—the entire essence of Him who is beyond all. Thus through the void- 
ing of all knowledge, he is joined in the better part of himself not with any 
creature, nor with himself, nor with another, but with Him who is inwardly 
unknowable; and in knowing nothing, he knows beyond the mind. 


Il. IN WHAT MANNER WE MUST NEEDS BE UNITED WITH GOD, AND OF THE 
PRAISE OF THE MAKER OF ALL THINGS, WHO IS ABOVE ALL. 


We long exceedingly to dwell in this translucent darkness, and through not 
seeing and not knowing to see and to know Him who is beyond both vision 
and knowledge—by the very fact of neither seeing Him nor knowing Him. For 
this is truly to see and to know, and, through the abandonment of all things, 
to praise Him who is beyond and above all. For this is not unlike the art of 
those who hew out a life-like image (from stone), removing from around it all 
that impedes clear vision of the latent form, showing its true hidden beauty 
solely by taking away. For it is, as I believe, more fitting to praise Him by taking 
away than by ascription, for we ascribe attributes to Him when we start from 
universals, and come down through the intermediate to particulars.’ But here 
we take away all things from Him, going up from particulars to universals, that 
we may know openly the unknowable, which is hidden in and under all things 
that may be known. And we behold that darkness beyond being, concealed 
under all natural light. 


II]. WHAT MAY BE AFFIRMED OF DIVINE TRUTH, AND WHAT DENIED. 


In the Theological Outlines” we have praised those things that fitly pertain to the 
theology of affirmation; how the divine and excellent Nature may be spoken of 
as One, and how as Three; how in accord therewith the Fatherhood of God may 
be explained, how the Sonship, and in what manner the truth of the Spirit may 
be revealed; how out of the incorporeal and undivided Excellence they put forth 
these three interior lights of goodness, and how in Himself and in Themselves, 
and in Their mutual and co-eternal propagation They remain together, nowhere 
going apart; how Jesus, while above all creation, may be in very truth of the 
substance of human nature; and whatsoever else that is set forth in Scripture we 
have explained in the Theological Outlines. And in the book Of the Divine Names 


178 CHRISTIANITY 


we have told how He may be called Good, Being, Life, Wisdom, and Power, 
and whatsoever else concerns the spiritual naming of God. In the Symbolic The- 
ology'® we have told what divine names may be taken from things of sense, as 
well as what divine forms, figures, members, instruments, heavenly places and 
realms (may be spoken of in terms of sensible images). We have also explained 
such other terms as are used as symbolic forms and sacred figures of the image 
of God (e.g., in the Old Testament), to wit the divine anger, sorrow, hatred, the 
inebriation and abandon, the swearing, cursing, sleeping and waking. 

I think, too, that you have understood how the discussion of particulars is 
more lengthy than of universals; for it was fitting that the Theological Outlines 
and the treatise Of the Divine Names be less wordy than the Symbolic Theology. 
For the more we aspire to higher things, the more our discourse upon things 
of the intellect is cut short, even as, when we enter that darkness that passes 
understanding, we shall find not brevity of speech but perfect silence and 
unknowing. Herein speech descends from the universal to the particular, and 
as it descends it is increased in proportion to the multiplicity of things. But 
now, in truth, it ascends from the particular to the universal, and going up is 
withdrawn as it rises, and after the whole ascent it becomes inwardly silent, 
entirely united with the ineffable. But for what reason, you ask, do we ascribe 
as the divine attributes things universal, and begin our negations (concerning 
the Divinity) from things particular? Because in ascribing, to That which is 
beyond all, attributes that are more fitting to Him, it is proper to ascribe things 
abstract. But in taking away attributes from Him who is beyond all privation 
we take away what is truly most remote from Him. For is He not more truly 
Life and Goodness than air and stone? And, on the other hand, is He not more 
truly remote from dissipation and anger than He is unspoken and unthought? 


IV. THat HE PARTAKES NOT OF SENSIBLE THINGS WHO IS 
PREEMINENTLY THEIR MAKER. 


We say, therefore, that the transcendent Maker of all things lacks neither being, 
nor life, nor reason, nor mind, yet He has no body; neither has he form, nor 
image, nor quality, nor quantity, nor bulk; He is in no place, nor is He seen, 
nor has He sensible touch; nor does He feel, nor is He felt, nor has He confu- 
sion and tumult, nor disturbance of material passions; neither is He without 
power, succumbing to the contingencies of sensible things; neither is His light 
in any deficiency, nor change, nor corruption, nor division, nor lack, nor flux, 
nor is He nor has He any other sensible thing. 


V. THat HE PARTAKES NOT OF INTELLIGIBLE THINGS WHO IS 
PREEMINENTLY THEIR MAKER.” 


Going yet higher, we say that He is neither a soul, nor a mind, nor an object 
of knowledge; neither has He opinion, nor reason, nor intellect; neither is He 


THEOLOGICA MYSTICA 179 


reason, nor thought, nor is He utterable or knowable; neither is He number, 
order, greatness, littleness, equality, inequality, likeness, nor unlikeness; neither 
does He stand nor move, nor is He quiescent; neither has He power, nor is 
power, nor light; neither does He live, nor is life; neither is He being, nor eter- 
nity, nor time, nor is His touch knowable; neither is He knowledge, nor truth, 
nor kingship, nor wisdom, nor one, nor one-ness, nor divinity, nor goodness; 
neither is He Spirit, as we can understand it, nor Sonship, nor Fatherhood, nor 
any other thing known to us or to any other creature; neither is He of things 
that are not, nor of things that are; neither do the things that are understand 
Him, as He is in Himself, nor does He Himself understand them as existing 
in themselves; neither is there utterance of Him, nor name, nor knowledge; 
neither is He darkness, nor light, nor falsehood, nor truth; neither is there any 
entire affirmation or negation that may be made concerning Him.'* But on 
the other hand we make affirmations and denials of those things that are less 
than Him (and follow from Him); but of Himself we neither affirm nor deny 
anything, since He who is beyond all attributes is perfect and alone the Cause 
of all—beyond all negation the height of that which is entirely free from all 
and beyond all. 


FROM THE EPISTLES 
EpistLe I, To Garus THERAPEUTES 


The divine darkness becomes invisible with light, and especially with much 
light. Knowledge’ obscures unknowing, and especially much knowledge. Take 
these sayings in a sublime and not in a negative sense, and understand this loss 
(of light and knowledge) as in relation to that Truth that is transcendent.” For 
that unknowing that is of God eludes those who possess light and knowledge 


' and His transcendent darkness is concealed 


(of God) in terms of creatures;? 
by every light and hidden to all knowing. And if anyone, seeing God, were 
to understand what he saw, he would not have seen God, but some one of 
His creatures that exist and may be known. But He that is set on high above 
mind and being, exists beyond being and is known beyond mind by the very 
fact that He is wholly unknowable and does not belong to the realm of being. 
And that perfect unknowing of the highest order is knowable of Him who is 


above all things known. 
EpistLeE V, To DoroTHEuS LITURGUS 


The divine darkness is the inaccessible light, wherein God is said to dwell.” 
And this darkness is indeed invisible because of supernal light, and inaccessible 
because of light too great in transcendent intensity, whereinto each one is born 
that is worthy to see and know God. Such a one, by the very fact of not seeing 
and not knowing, truly enters into Him who is beyond sight and knowledge, 


180 CHRISTIANITY 


knowing this, too, that He is in all things that are felt and known. At this he 
says with the prophet, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I 
cannot attain unto it,’”—even as the blessed Paul is said to have known God 
in knowing Him as beyond all thought and knowledge. For which reason he 
says that His ways are past finding out, His judgments unsearchable, His gifts 
indescribable, and His peace passing all understanding. This he says as one 
who has found Him who is beyond all, and has known this that is beyond 
thought—that He, being the Cause of all, is beyond all. 


NOTES 


1. I should like here to express my thanks to Father Whittemore, Superior of 
the Order of the Holy Cross, for a number of valuable suggestions in the preparation 
of the introduction; and to Mr. Adolph Teichert, III, for his generous assistance in the 
publication of the text. 


2. Originally supposed to be St. Paul’s Athenian convert, St. Dionysius was probably 
a Syrian monk of the late fifth or early sixth century. His works were widely quoted and 
deeply respected by mystical and theological writers of the middle ages, and notably by 
St. Thomas Aquinas, who regarded them as of the highest authority. 

3. There are also a number of excellent modern works upon the subject. A 
standard but somewhat ponderous work is Poulain’s (1910) Graces of Interior Prayer. 
Saudreau’s (1924) Mystical State is a particularly sound and valuable discussion of the 
various phases of mystical union. One of the best works for introductory purposes is 
Hughson’s (1935) Contemplative Prayer to which should be added the various works of 
Fr. Bede Frost (e.g., 1931, 1939). An extremely full and profitable discussion is in Evelyn 
Underhill’s (1930) Mysticism. 

4. While the purpose of this translation of the Theologia Mystica and of the first 
and fifth Epistles of St. Dionysius the pseudo-Areopagite is devotional rather than 
academic, it should be said here that with a few exceptions it follows the text given in 
Migne’s Patrologiae Graecae, vol. 3. This text has been compared with the earliest Latin 
version, by John Scotus Erigena, in Migne’s Patrologiae Latinae, vol. 122. The translation 
comprises all his strictly mystical writings. I should like here to express my thanks to the 
Reverend E. J. Templeton, S. T. M, Instructor in Greek and Hebrew at Seabury-Western 
Theological Seminary, for his careful checking of the translation. 

5. “Beyond being” (hyperousios). A more literal translation of the Greek would 
be “super-essential,” a word of common recurrence in the Dionysian writings. It is not 
likely that St. Dionysious used the term ousia (substantia) in the sense of the Nicene- 
Constantinopolitan Creed, where God's essence or substance is understood as His very 
nature. It would be sheer nonsense to say that God is beyond His own essence. Nor 
are we to understand God as beyond being in the Thomist sense of the word ens. The 
thought is rather that God is beyond all objective and derived essence and existence, 
which is to say every kind of being that the human mind can conceive. God is, but not 
in the same manner that anything else is. 

6. The meaning is obviously to quit the senses, etc., in so far as the quest for 
knowledge of God is concerned. The would-be contemplative is not advised to become 


THEOLOGICA MYSTICA 181 


as unintelligent and unfeeling as a lump of stone, taking complete and final leave of 
his senses. 

7. Unkowningly. The term unknowing (agnosia) is one of the Dionysian keywords, 
meaning much more than mere ignorance or absence of knowledge. To know God by 
unknowing is to surrender the mind entirely to God instead of trying to possess God as 
a concept of the mind or an object of knowledge. The mind knows God by unknowing 
in the same way that the soul is saved by losing itself. To abandon the mind to the Void 
of the “divine darkness” in the loving faith that God is there, is the equivalent of aban- 
doning the body to a sacrificial death in the full faith that God is beyond the darkness of 
the grave. In either case the very act is accompanied by a mysterious sense of the peace 
and joy of God, which is why the darkness of unknowing is described as full of light. 

8. Psalm 18:11. 

9. Lit: “in terms of those things last in being (ta eschata).” The “last things in 
being” are those most removed, functionally but not morally, from God—i.e., particular, 
material objects. The strong Neoplatonic influence in Dionysian thought is apparent here. 

10. To negate and impute, affirm and deny, ascribe and take away,—these terms 
denote the two ways of knowing God, according to His immanence and according to 
His transcendence. To know God through His immanent self-revelation in creatures is, 
in Dionysian terminology, kataphatic knowledge; to know Him as beyond creatures, to 
approach Him negatively in the understanding that He is neither this creature nor that, 
is apophatic knowledge. 

11. Dionysian mysticism has no connection with the so-called mysticism of visions 
and “psychic experiences,” preoccupation with which can be one of the most misleading 
false trails that cross the mystic’s path. This is not to say, however, that all such visions 
are inherently false. On the contrary, God does on occasion vouchsafe distinct visions of 
supernatural things for purposes of conversion or encouragement. But these are not the 
true end of the mystical quest, which lies in the realm of essence and not appearance. 

12. Exodus 19. 

13. Exodus 33:18-23. 

14. Here again, the text is treating of the two ways of knowing God, for, accord- 
ing to Neoplatonic ideas, the creative, self-revelatory process begins from universals and 
works downward and outwards to particulars. This is God’s decent to man, but man’s 
ascent to God works up from particulars, through universals, which are the highest 
created things, and beyond to the essence of God Himself. 


15. One of the supposedly lost works of St. Dionysius. It is possible, however, that 
the phrase theologikai hypotyposeis refers to his treatises in general and not to a particular 
work, although in this chapter he clearly refers to other treatises by name. 

16. Another of the lost works. The reference here is unequivocal. 

17. This chapter may easily be misunderstood if it is not remembered that when 
St. Dionysius says that God is not reason, or power, or light, or goodness, he means 
that He is not these things as we are able to experience them with our created minds 
and senses. We have only seen and known created light and power, and goodness as it 
exists in creatures, and these created qualities are not God because He has made them. 

18. Created light or truth is the polar opposite of creaturely darkness or falsehood, 
but God does not stand in relation to darkness and falsehood as its polar opposite, for 


182 CHRISTIANITY 


this would degrade Him to equality with them. The goodness of God is therefore 
in no dualistic or mutually interdependent relationship with evil, as is purely human 
goodness. Our created minds cannot grasp the mystery of evil because they cannot rise 
above dualism and conceive an order of goodness, which is definitively not evil and yet 
is not the equal and opposite of evil. Because purely human goodness is the equal and 
opposite of evil it can have no final victory over it. But God has final victory over evil 
because He is not in a dualistic relation to it. Evil is creaturely, and the dualistic relation 
can be between one creature and another, but not between Creator and creature. The 
absolute and essential goodness of God has no opposite which can limit and condition 
it so far as He Himself is concerned. Deo nihil opponitur. 


19. This is a special sense of the word knowledge, the original term being gnoses 
(in the plural). Here again, it is not meant that God is obscured by ordinary work-a-day 
knowledge of people and things, but that (a) gnoses in the sense of so-called objective 
knowledge or visions of God obscure the genuine mystical knowledge (agnosia); or (b) 
that the mystical union is impeded by gnoses in the sense of conceptual notions of God 
adhered to as final and ultimate truth. 


20. The latter part of this sentence is a free rendering of the Greek apopheson 
hyperalethos, or “apophatize super-truly,” which is impossible English. 


21. The text as in Migne does not make sense here, and the translation given fol- 
lows the text of the Codex Dionysianus and the Latin version of Erigena. 


22. 1 Timothy 6:6. 
23. Psalm 139:6. 
24. Romans 11:33; 2 Corinthians 9:15; Philippians 4:7.

The Case for God (1946) 


he existence of God can be proved, but not demonstrated. It can be 

proved by the same method that a man is proved guilty of theft in 
a court of law, when neither judge nor jury have seen the theft committed, and 
the thief has not been caught in the act of stealing. Under these circumstances 
the thief is proved guilty by reasoning from evidence gathered at the scene of the 
crime, or from other sources. His guilt is not demonstrated beyond all possible 
doubt because his crime was not seen. There is a remote chance that someone 
else committed it. But the court is assured of his guilt because there is no flaw 
in the chain of reasoning that concludes his guilt from the evidence. 

In the same way the existence of God cannot be demonstrated beyond all 
possible doubt because he cannot be seen. He is invisible and intangible. But from 
the evidence of the universe and of our five senses we can prove the existence 
of God by the same method that would satisfy a court of law in the case of 
a crime. We can prove it by a chain of reasoned argument in which there is 
no flaw. The argument can only be contested by doubting the evidence of our 
senses and the principles of reason, which is to say, by committing intellectual 
suicide. For once we doubt our own senses and the laws of reason, intelligent 
thought and discussion about life become impossible. Since modern philoso- 
phers have taken this doubt seriously, philosophy has largely degenerated into 
a profitless and unfruitful wrangling not about life, but about the processes of 
thought—about whether anything can be known at all. 

It is not presumption to attempt to prove the existence of God by reason. 
It is, on the contrary, the duty of reason and the chief purpose for which this

faculty is given to us. Those who can reason have no excuse for doubting the 
existence of God, for, in the words of St. Paul, “The invisible things of God 
since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the 
things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may 
be without excuse” (Romans 1:20). 


THE EVIDENCE OF THE UNIVERSE AND MAN 


The evidence upon which the reasoned proof of God’s existence is based is 
provided by our senses. It is the fact of a universe containing man who perceives 
and thinks about it. But the existence of this universe does not explain itself; 
it does not show us how it came into existence, nor yet how it is maintained 
in being. In other words, we do not see its cause. Does the universe cause 
itself? Obviously not, for the universe is simply the sum total of things, and 
none of them causes its own being. They are caused, directly and immediately, 
by other things that come before them, as we are caused by our parents. By 
scientific research we may trace these direct causes back some considerable 
distance. Organic life may be traced back to the original protoplasm that lived 
in primaeval slime. The inorganic matter of mountains, waters and stars is 
traced to less diversified and complex centers of stellar energy. 

But here, without going back any further, we find the chain of direct causes 
ceasing to explain itself. The evidence now before us contains elements that 
simple protoplasm and stellar energy do not explain. It contains the complex 
and (at least relatively) ordered structure of stellar systems, of crystals, and of a 
thousand electrical and chemical phenomena. It contains the still more complex 
and ordered structures of organic life, of eyes, ears, hearts and stomachs, and 
finally of the human mind, which reflects upon itself and upon the impres- 
sions of its senses. Can we admit that stellar energy or simple protoplasm are 
adequate or sufficient causes for such highly complex and organized things? 

Every effect must have a sufficient cause. That is to say, something cannot 
be caused by nothing, because nothing is not sufficient to cause something. 
In the same way, figs do not grow on thistles because there is nothing in a 
thistle sufficient to produce a fig. It doesn’t have it in it to make a fig, just as a 
moron doesn’t have it in him to become a mathematician. Our problem then 
is: Do matter and energy, or atoms and electrons, have it in them to produce 
protoplasm, and through protoplasm to produce man? 

Let us admit that they do, and see where this admission takes us. Let us 
also assume, along with materialists and others who deny the existence of God, 
that this primal matter-energy is a purely blind and unintelligent substance. 
(Why do they assume this while confessedly ignorant of what substance is?) 
Matter-energy must therefore produce its effects, not by intelligence or con- 
scious design, but by untold billions of permutations and combinations that 
necessarily, if they go on long enough, produce the universe and man. Even 


THE CASE FOR GOD 185 


monkeys, it is said, typing for long enough on enough typewriters would be 
bound eventually to write the Bible. This is to say, therefore, that blind and 
unconscious elements are a sufficient cause for this universe, provided that 
they are able to combine and re-combine haphazardly for a sufficient length of 
time. By pure statistical necessity, a human mind will eventually be the result. 
What, therefore, we term mind, intelligence and personality are in fact peculiar 
arrangements of atoms produced in course of time by blind necessity. To put it 
more simply, intelligence is a special form of unintelligence, and consciousness 
a special form of unconsciousness. 

Granting that this position is not already absurd, let us take it a step further. 
The individual who argues in this way is himself the product of blind necessity; 
his argument, which is part of himself, is likewise the haphazard result of neces- 
sity. Because, then, his argument is part of the universe, he cannot claim for it 
what he denies to the universe—meaning. He can only claim that the meaning 
of his argument is a special form of meaninglessness. He is then saying that 
the presence of a thing (meaning) is a special form of its absence, or indeed 
that something is a special form of nothing. To deny intelligence to your own 
sufficient cause is to deny it to yourself. If all sense is in fact a peculiar kind 
of nonsense, man’s intellectual suicide is complete. He might just as well be 
reciting “Jabberwocky” as propounding philosophical theories. 

Furthermore, his entire argument began with a huge begging of the ques- 
tion. Quite arbitrarily he has termed the principle substance of the universe 
blind and unconscious. This is a mere guess, for he admits he does not know 
what substance is. Why, then, does he make this assumption? Because he wishes 
to deny his own spiritual and rational responsibility, because he finds it morally 
inconvenient to admit that he is what he seems to be—a free, rational, and 
conscious person. By showing that he and all his thoughts and deeds are the 
results of blind necessity, he can renounce responsibility for himself. But not 
only does his argument begin with a purely arbitrary assumption; it ends in 
the denial of its own rationality and meaningfulness. 

But the argument for the existence of God begins with an assumption 
that is not arbitrary, an assumption that we make naturally and are compelled 
to make in order to live any kind of rational life. It begins with the evidence 
(or assumption, if you insist) of sense, feeling and intuition that man is a con- 
scious, intelligent, responsible, and relatively free person. We have therefore to 
account for the appearance of this intelligent and self-conscious thing called 
a person. Personality cannot be explained as a special form of impersonality, 
any more than the playing of a violin can be explained as the mere scraping 
of cat’s entrails with horsehair. The emergence of human personality from the 
universe must have a sufficient cause, which is to say a cause that itself has the 
property of personality. The cause of personality must be at least personal since 
the lesser cannot of itself make the greater, the presence of a thing cannot be 
explained in terms of its absence, and something cannot come out of nothing. 


186 CHRISTIANITY 


The principle evidence for the existence of God is not just the fact of an 
objective, organized universe. It is rather the appearance of man in it as a part 
of it. If the universe is the effect of a cause, consciousness cannot appear in 
the effect without existing in the cause. The cause must be sufficient to pro- 
duce the effect, to evolve from substance and protoplasm all the properties of 
human personality—not only consciousness, intelligence and reason, but also 
love, goodness, and beauty. 


THE FIVE PROOFS OF ST. THOMAS 


Having considered the principle evidence, the reduction to absurdity of the 
contrary position, and the general scope of the reasoned argument for God’s 
existence, we can turn to the details of the proof, following the five different 
ways of proof proposed by Saint Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologica. 

1. The first proof has to do with the origin of motion. The fact that things 
are in motion is clearly perceived by our senses, as well as the fact that their 
motion does not originate in themselves. Everything that is moved is moved, 
at least originally, by something other than itself. We are forced to one of two 
conclusions: either motion begins with a “first mover,” which, unlike every- 
thing else, is absolutely self moved, or that there is no origin of motion, that 
the series of movers and moved goes back forever to infinity. But if motion is 
forever derived from something else and never originates in anything, motion 
must be without origin and without cause. But this would lead to one of two 
absurd conclusions: (1) that it is then its own cause, which, seeing that it is 
always derived from something else, is impossible, or (2) that it is a causeless 
effect, a something emerging from nothing, which is also impossible. We are 
compelled, then, to accept the idea of a First Mover, absolutely self moved and 
the cause of all other motion. And we might add to St. Thomas’s argument 
that since man is the most self-moving of known beings, it is highly probable 
that the First Mover is a living Being rather than an impersonal force. 

2. The second proof is akin to the first, seeking the First Cause instead of 
the First Mover. We know of nothing that is its own cause, and unless we can 
arrive at a First Cause we are left with the absurd conclusion that there is simply 
an infinite series of causes and effects, the whole of which hangs absolutely 
uncaused in a void, like the Cheshire Cat’s grin in Alice in Wonderland. For we 
do not only have to find the first, beginning cause of the series. Even if the 
universe were eternal and had no beginning in time, it would still have to have 
a cause beyond itself; otherwise it would be like a country where all made their 
living by taking in each other’s washing. That is to say, if every cause in the 
series was an effect, the whole would be an effect without a cause. The mere 
size or duration of such a series, such an uncaused universe, would make no 
difference to its absurdity. To make it infinitely long or infinitely large is only to 


THE CASE FOR GOD 187 


make it infinitely absurd. There must therefore be a First Cause that is not an 
effect of anything but itself; “and this” concludes St. Thomas, “men call God.” 

3. There is nothing in the universe that exists in its own right, for of all 
things that we know it is possible for them both to be and not to be. Obviously 
a thing that has the possibility of not existing does not exist necessarily—in its 
own right; if it existed necessarily it could never cease to exist. If, then, things 
do not have being in their own right, they must derive being from something 
else. A series of beings, none of which exist in their own right, all of which 
derive their existence from one another, is by itself impossible—however enor- 
mous it may be. If every being in the series derives its existence from some- 
thing else, the whole series must also derive its existence from something else. 
For a being that can at some time not exist is not an eternal being,’ and no 
number of temporal beings will add up to an eternal being just as no number 
of geometric points will add up to a line, and no amount of shapes will make 
a color. But if there is no eternal being there was a time when things were 
not, in which case they could never have come into existence. Therefore there 
must be an eternal being that exists necessarily, in its own right, which does 
not have being (and so can possibly not have it) but which is being. And this, 
too, is what men call God. 

4. The fourth proof is based on the different grades of perfection to be 
found in things. There are, for example, varying degrees of warmth and of 
consciousness. Things are understood to be more or less warm or more or 
less conscious to the extent they approach that which is most warm and most 
conscious. Something that is less warm cannot become more warm by itself. 
The extra warmth must come from somewhere, and that can only be from 
what is most warm, i.e., fire, in one form or another. We are saying, in fact, 
that there cannot be less or more of a given quality or perfection until there 
is a most, from which the less and the more can be derived. If there is not a 
most perfect form that the less and the more perfect can be derived, we are 
saying that the greater can be explained in terms of the less, that more of a 
given quality is the result of less of it—which is manifest nonsense. Therefore 
all perfections in all things must be explained with reference to a most perfect 
Being that does not receive perfection from another, but that possess the fullness 
of these perfections in its own right. Man is more conscious than the animal; 
man, however, is not the most conscious because animals do not derive their 
consciousness from man. Thus the necessary most conscious and most perfect 
being will be what we call God. 

5. The fifth proof comes from the fact of a certain order in unintelligent 
things—a type of order that is not simply read into them by the human mind. 
For example, the eye of a bird is ordered toward seeing. The power of sight is 
for the good of the bird, yet certainly the bird has neither the intelligence nor 
power to produce its own eye and order it to the perception of light as distinct 


188 CHRISTIANITY 


from sound and smell. The fact that unintelligent things are ordered toward 
ends—eyes to seeing, ears to hearing, nerves to feeling, lungs to breathing—is 
not to be explained by chance, because to do so would be to commit the old 
error of explaining order in terms of disorder. Both the idea and the fact of 
chance presuppose the existence of order and purpose, and even if we say that 
the notion of order exists only in the human mind we have still to explain its 
existence there. But the ordering of eyes to seeing is in no sense an “imagined” 
order that the mind of man reads into external events as, perhaps, he reads design 
and beauty into the patterns of frost upon a window. Yet because eyes and a 
million other natural phenomena clearly do not order themselves to their ends, 
there must be an intelligence directing them; and this intelligence we call God. 


THE NATURE OF GOD 


The five proofs of St. Thomas tell us not only that God exists; they tell us also 
something of what God is like. From the first, which has to do with motion, 
we learn that God is power. From the second, dealing with God as the First 
Cause, we see that God is creative power. From the third we learn not just that 
God has being, but that he is Being itself. The fourth adds to this that God is 
not mere being; he does not simply exist like a stone, or a man after a heavy 
dinner. God is the fullness of Being, possessing every perfection of which Being 
is capable. And finally the fifth tells us that God is the source of all intelligence, 
order, and design. 

Reason, therefore, leads us not only to the fact that God is; it gives us also 
some knowledge of his nature, though this knowledge is incomplete beside 
God’s own revelation of himself in the prophets and in Jesus Christ. There 
are, however, three specially important aspects of the divine nature that reason 
deduces from our experience of the universe, and though implied in the fore- 
going argument, it will be well to examine them more closely since nothing 
detracts more from belief in God than absurdly unworthy ideas of his nature. 

1. The first is that God is life. The sufficient cause of a universe containing 
persons must, as we saw, be at least personal—that is to say, a living, conscious, 
intelligent and integrated being. God is the most of qualities that we find in 
more or less degree in the world, and because created things are more or less 
alive God is that which is most alive. The higher a form of life, the greater 
its degree of consciousness and integration, and the greater its independence 
of physical limitations. We are thus led to the thought of God as one who is 
absolute consciousness, absolute wholeness and unity, and absolute freedom 
from other than self-imposed limitation. Therefore to say that God is personal 
is in no sense to limit or belittle him. It is not to imprison God in a form or 
shape. On the contrary, it is to say that he is the absolute maximum of life and 
freedom, bursting, as it were, the bonds of form and finitude not because he 
is vague and misty but because he is utterly and intensely alive. 


THE CASE FOR GOD 189 


The idea of a personal God is so often criticized as idolatry, as making 
God in man’s image. But the alternatives offered by such critics are yet more 
idolatrous since they conceive God in terms of less living forms than man—as 
blind and abstract mechanism, force or principle, unlimited only in the inane 
and vacuous sense of infinite space or aether. The error of idolatry is not that 
it makes a finite image of the infinitely Vast and Vague, but that it is an attempt 
to capture the infinitely Alive One in a fixed, dead and petrified form of thought 
or imagination. Try to capture the wind in a bag and you have only stagnant 
air. Thus the assertion that God is personal is not to say that God is like man; 
it is to say that man, in so far as he is personal, is something like God, having 
in some slight degree the awareness, the selfhood, the unity, the intelligence, 
and the freedom of absolute and perfect life. 

2. The second is that God is being—he who IS, the only one who can truly 
say, “I am.” It is this truth that leads us to the knowledge of God’s perfection 
and goodness. A perfect thing is a complete thing, a thing that lacks nothing 
and is not frustrated or limited by anything else. As the first cause, as necessary 
being, and as the source of all possible perfections to be found in creatures, 
God is obviously quite self-sufficient and lacks nothing. If there were anything 
that he lacked, he could not be its cause, and if some being or quality existed 
uncaused by God, he would not be the first cause, in which case he would 
not be God. In general, however, things are limited and frustrated by their 
opposites—life by death, pleasure by pain, and joy by sorrow. Not only are they 
limited by their opposites, but they cannot exist without them, as life (as we 
know it) cannot exist without death since it lives on dead plants and animals. 

But because God is being he has no opposite. The opposite of being is 
nothing, which by definition doesn’t exist. God, then, is called good because he 
is the triumphant and unopposed fullness of being, possessing every perfection, 
every positive and excellent quality of which being is capable. Yet we are used 
to thinking of evil as the opposite of good, and if God is the purely good, must 
not evil be his opposite? We are mistaken in calling evil the opposite of good. 
We should think rather of evil as the attempt to oppose good, an attempt that 
can never succeed since to oppose the good entirely and successfully would be 
to cease from being. Evil is a parasite upon the good, depending on the good 
for its existence. For example, an evil handkerchief is one containing a hole—a 
handkerchief lacking complete being and going in the direction of nonbeing. A 
purely evil Handkerchief would be one that was all hole. It would not exist at 
all. Yet whereas the handkerchief can exist without a hole (the good without 
the evil), the hole cannot exist without the handkerchief (the evil without the 
good). Evil is thus dependent upon and subordinate to good; it is not its equal 
and opposite. 

All evil is destructive. In whatever form it is a tendency toward nonexis- 
tence, for the things we call evil are those that destroy and inhibit life, which 
makes holes in things otherwise complete and perfect. We praise God as the 


190 CHRISTIANITY 


absolutely good because it is impossible to “make holes in him.” One who 
exists necessarily, who is being, cannot be made to cease to be even partially. 
But from one who only has being, being can partially or wholly be taken away. 

The fact that God, as being, has no opposite makes him the Supreme Good 
in the sense of the supremely desirable One, the true, if unacknowledged, object 
of all human yearning. For the heart of man desires to have life, happiness, love 
and peace eternally. But this desire is frustrated again and again because these 
various goods, as we ordinarily experience them, have opposites upon which 
they depend. As created life is opposed to and dependent on death, created 
happiness is unknown apart from the contrast of sorrow. A life independent of 
death, and a happiness independent of sorrow can only be the eternal life and 
happiness of God himself. Hence the only final satisfaction of human desire 
must be found in a union of man with God so intimate that man becomes a 
partaker of the divine nature. This will be possible if it is true that to become 
one life with God is the purpose for which man exists, if man is ordered to 
union with God as the eye is ordered to the perception of light. 

3. The third important aspect of the divine nature is, then, that God is love. 
Love is the unreserved giving of one’s whole being to another person. As the 
noblest and most positive of all human virtues, it is necessarily derived from 
God, who must possess it, like all other perfections, in the very highest degree. 
But God does not simply have these perfections just as he does not simply have 
being. In order to be the sufficient cause of a certain quality, he must not only 
have it; he must be it, and thus we may say that God is love. 

Creation itself is an act of the divine love, because in creating God gives 
himself to others. A person or a thing can only exist because God has given 
it a share in his own being. And since he is one and indivisible, God gives his 
whole being, his whole mind, his whole will, to every single creature that he 
makes, although each creature receives the gift of God in accordance with its 
capacity. Man receives the gift more perfectly than a stone, but no creature 
can receive it with absolute perfection because in so doing it would cease to 
be a creature and become God. We receive God partially, but he gives himself 
wholly; the degree to which we can receive him will depend on our likeness 
to God, who, like the sun, sheds down the entire light of his love upon every 
place and thing. And as bright objects reflect the sun more perfectly and dark 
objects less perfectly, so the life and the love of God is received with varying 
degrees of perfection although it is given to all alike. 

The special peculiarity of man is that being a person, an image of God, he 
can return that love. Under certain circumstances man can give the whole of 
himself to God as God gives the whole of himself to man. For this reason there 
can exist between God and man the most intimate of all unions—the union 
of love, the Spiritual Marriage. Love necessarily desires union with the beloved 
object, and love turns into the bitterest suffering if that union cannot be had. It 


THE CASE FOR GOD 191 


would therefore be contrary to every reasonable idea of the divine perfection 
and justice if man were capable of loving God, but not of union with him. 

The good news, the gospel, of the Christian religion is precisely that 
God has given man the power to receive this union, to become one life with 
God and to share and enjoy eternally his unopposed goodness, love, peace, 
and happiness. The realization of this union is what is meant by “going to 
heaven,” and the imagery of wings and harps and halos, of the celestial city 
whose temple, light and center is God, of the unending song of praise and 
adoration, is designed to tell us in symbolic form of the joy and illumination 
of those who have become one with God and transfigured into his radiance 
like iron plunged into fire. 


CONCLUSION 


Human reason, just because it is human and not divine, cannot be absolutely 
perfect, and consequently the reasoned proof of God’s existence and the rea- 
soned deduction of what his nature must be cannot have absolute certainty. Two 
things, however, may safely be claimed. First, it is clear that belief in God is 
more reasonable than any other theory of ultimate Reality that human reason 
has to offer.* To suspend judgment on the bare chance that this reasoning 
may not be true, is like refusing to go out of the house because of the much 
stronger chance that you may be hit by an automobile. It is a thousand times 
easier to prove that you can trust in God than that you can trust yourself to 
the hazards of a city street. People do the latter every day. That they do not 
do the former can only be attributed either to inability to reason, or to sheer 
moral cowardice, or, in some cases, to mere lack of information. 

Secondly, it is also clear that a reasoned consideration of God’s existence and 
nature shows that this central doctrine of Christianity, together with its necessary 
implications, is not at all the crude, naive, and superstitious notion it is currently 
supposed to be. The Christian Church does not teach that the ultimate Reality 
is a cosmic superman with white whiskers who sits upon a golden throne above 
the stars. Nor, however, does it commit the opposite folly of supposing that God 
is merely the personification of our highest ideals who exists only in the sense of 
Uncle Sam. It does not even ask us to believe in God as a “gaseous vertebrate,” 
or as a rather large, ubiquitous and beneficent superspook. 

On the contrary, it carries human reason to the highest, the most sublime, 
the most subtle idea that it can form; and, having taken it to that splendid 
height, makes it bow down in wonder and humility—the philosopher with the 
child—because on the very topmost peak one thing becomes certain beyond all 
else: that the Reality so far surpasses the idea in glory that all human knowledge 
is seen as comparative ignorance, and the curious chatter of thought becomes 
the loving silence of contemplation.

NOTES 


1. A thing that either begins or ends is by definition not eternal. The eternal can 
neither start not finish, because this would constitute an end to what is by definition 
endless. A start is an end in the same sense that the “beginning” of a road is one end 
of the road. 

2. The fact that the argument for the existence of God does not of itself answer 
various related problems, such as the existence of evil and suffering, is nothing against 
it. It is only when its conclusions are seen to be true that the problem of evil is raised.

ike all highly developed organisms, the Catholic Church is com- 

| Been) It is so complicated that both churchmen and outsiders 

are apt to lose sight of the forest because of the multitude and the variety of 
trees, and this danger is most present when we are considering the Church’s 
organic structure—the complex sacramental life of Christ’s Mystical Body. Few 
churchmen understand what Christianity is about, what are its essential and basic 
principles, and what is its ultimate goal. At the same time there are plenty of 
churchmen who have a very thorough knowledge of secondary principles. They 
can tell you what the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is, what the sacraments are, 
what are the rules and precepts of the moral and spiritual life, but they can- 
not, or do not, tell you what they mean. They present you with a complex of 
interesting but unrelated information, all of which has some vague connection 
with the salvation of one’s soul. But if you will inquire carefully, you will find 
that not one Christian in fifty (a generous estimate) can tell you what salvation 
means, except perhaps that it has something to do with moral goodness. This 
ignorance is largely due to the fact that Catholic worship involves so much 
liturgical and sacramental “know how” that in the few hours available for reli- 
gious education there is little time left for instruction in basic principles—the 
nature of God, the destiny of man, the meaning of salvation. The Anglican 
Communion complicates things still further with a mania for ecclesiastical his- 
tory so great that the average confirmand knows more about Henry VIII and 
Matthew Parker than he knows about God—and I am sometimes afraid that 
the same thing might said of the average student in our theological seminaries.

194 CHRISTIANITY 


No discussion, therefore, of one of the functions of Christ’s Mystical Body, 
in this case the priesthood, can be intelligible unless it is related immediately to 
fundamentals. There are, I believe, three basic principles, which, if understood, 
will clarify everything in the Catholic religion from contemplative prayer to the 
blessing of holy water, and these are the three principles in relation to which 
we are going to consider the organic function of the priesthood. Briefly they 
are these: 

1. That since God is love, and since the goal of love is union with its object, 
the aim of the Christian religion, that is, salvation, is to realize the eternal 
union of man with God. By union I do not mean identity but a perfect union 
of different things, as when color and shape unite to form, say, a red circle. 

2. That this union is realized through mutual love between God and man, 
where love is defined as giving oneself wholly and unreservedly to another. 
God gives himself wholly to man, and man gives himself wholly, in body, soul 
and spirit to God." 

3. That this union is achieved, in the first instance, by God who initiates 
the union by giving himself and his own eternal life to sinful men. “Herein,” 
wrote St. John, “is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us.” It fol- 
lows, therefore, that eternal life is not a prize to be earned but a free gift to be 
realized, appreciated and used. In other words, Christian sanctity is not what 
we do to get union with God; it is what we do with it. It follows also that the 
Catholic Church is not an association formed by men to discover God, but an 
association formed by God to discover men. 

It is significant that the second of these principles, at least in part, is far 
more widely recognized and understood than either the first or the third. 
Every Christian, and for that matter every Jew and every Hindu, understands 
that religion involves the giving, the dedication of himself to God—in a word, 
sacrifice. The truth that sacrifice is of the essence of religion is a revelation that 
has penetrated human consciousness from time immemorial. But in practice 
the other two principles have been minimized and obscured because, for dimly 
conscious reasons, we cannot quite bear them. A false humility makes us timid 
in acknowledging the tremendous destiny that God has prepared us—eternal 
union with his own divine Being—a destiny that popular notions of heaven 
almost entirely obscure. And the glorious message of the Christian gospel, 
that in Christ God has freely given us this union, is a complete outrage to our 
pride. For it means that God has put us in an infinite and irrepayable debt, 
and we are so embarrassed by such unmerited love that we are loath to admit 
it and adopt almost any means to conceal it. Thus the average Christian of 
today hears little or nothing of the gift of union with God, of divine sonship; 
he hears only that Christ came to the world to cancel past debts, to give him 
a fresh start, to set him an example of righteousness, and to bestow upon him 
a dose of spiritual power to help him earn his passage to heaven. 


THE MEANING OF PRIESTHOOD 195 


Therefore as popularly conceived there is no essential difference between 
Christianity and any other form of ethical theism, between the old law of Moses 
and the prophets and the new dispensation of Christ. The only difference is 
one of degree—as if our Lord had come into the world merely to give us a 
fresh start with a new and improved moral law, a bigger and better Pharisaism, 
a more rigorous and demanding code of sacrifice. In actual practice popular 
Christianity is no more than a rarified Judaism, though Catholics are perhaps 
less prone to this error than liberal Protestants, and the reason is simply that 
the world does not want to face the implications of the Incarnation. According 
to the liberals it would seem that the only difference between the old covenant 
and the new is that the price of redemption is no longer the sacrifice of bulls 
and goats but the sacrifice of one’s very self, with the encouragement of Christ’s 
example. In this case the gospel is not very good news. A more Catholic type 
of misunderstood Christianity embellishes this story with one rather dubious 
improvement: that whereas the sacrifice of bulls and goats and obedience to 
the law of Moses would not purchase entry to heaven, the sacrifice of oneself 
will—because Christ has opened the gates. God, in other words, has agreed to 
let us in, though now he is talking in terms of a vastly increased entrance fee. 

Of course it has been stated very briefly, but in fact that is about as much 
of the truth of Christianity as manages to reach the mind of the ordinary 
Christian. In practice the doctrine of the Atonement means to him no more 
than that Christ has opened the very distant gates of heaven, and because the 
age of the old covenant, when the gates were closed, is so remote in time the 
fact that they are now open has lost its impressive novelty. The rest of the 
truth, wherein lies the full splendor of the gospel, the truth of one “full, per- 
fect and sufficient sacrifice, oblation and satisfaction for the sins of the whole 
world” is for him a veiled and incomprehensible mystery. In effect, therefore, 
most Christians are still trying to live under the conditions of the old covenant, 
wherein each man’s own sacrifice, not of bulls and goats but of his whole life, 
is the only means of finding favor with God. 

It follows, then, that the popular conception of the Christian ministry differs 
only superficially from the priestly and prophetic ministry of the old covenant. 
The minister is holy, not because he is an ordinary sinner called to a special 
union with Christ, but because he himself has dedicated his own life to God, 
and is specially righteous as a vicarious sacrifice for his people or at best as an 
example of individual goodness and individual sacrifice for them to follow. The 
people dance and drink, but not the minister. The people laugh and joke and 
relax, but not the minister, save perhaps in an obviously artificial manner so that 
we may be sure it isn't real. The Protestant minister is a subtle and up-to-date 
form of human sacrifice, and what he ministers is not the gift of union with 
God but “precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon 
line.” At least, that’s what seems to be expected of him, though the grace of 


196 CHRISTIANITY 


God sometimes makes him more human and lovable. The Catholic priesthood 
is, on the whole, in a rather better position, despite the fact that a family will 
offer a son for the priesthood in much the same spirit as an old Hebrew family 
would offer first-fruits for the altar. And do the people understand him as one 
who ministers union with God in Christ? On the contrary, he is all too often 
the mere mediator of individual sacrifices of a crudely commercial character— 
“sacrifices of masses” to be had at so much cash, remission of sins for so many 
“Hail Marys,” curtailment of Purgatory for so many novenas. But at least his 
people get the impression that somehow or other he is a source of life and 
power, however magical and trivial its nature. 

But the truth contained in the Old Testament, that sacrifice, and sacrifice 
involving our own lives, plays some essential part in our relations with God, 
still remains. Without sacrifice creatures cannot be made holy, which is to say 
healthy, whole, one with God. The word sacrifice itself has the double mean- 
ing of offering a thing to God and making a thing holy. Man is created for 
union with God in love, and since love consists in giving oneself to another 
freely, man’s love of God is precisely sacrifice, the free surrender of his whole 
being—physical, mental, and spiritual—to God. To be acceptable to God a 
sacrifice must be perfect, and in practice this means that it must be offered to 
God absolutely, without conditions or reservations, because the only way to 
render a human life without blemish is to put it entirely in the hands of God. 

Obviously the priesthood of the old covenant was quite inadequate to 
achieve such a sacrifice. To begin with, what it offered at the altar was not 
human life but mere symbolic tokens of that life—portions of the meat and 
drink whereby that life was sustained. Furthermore, it was a purely human 
priesthood, and one individual human being can no more sacrifice for another 
than he can eat another’s food for him. How much less could he offer another 
person’s whole life to God, when the essence of such an offering is that it be 
one’s own free action? For individual human persons are mutually exclusive; I 
am I, and you are you; I cannot see through your eyes; I cannot, unless you 
permit me, command your will; I cannot surrender your soul to God. Thus the 
priesthood of the old covenant was only a sign, a type, a figure of what had to 
be done. The sacrifices that it offered could not effect the forgiveness of sins 
because they could not effect union with God: the two states are one and the 
same. God is forgiveness; his “nature and property is always to have mercy,” 
and to be one with God is to be one with forgiveness. Under the old covenant 
each man was in reality his own priest, because the real sacrifice required by 
God was that every man should offer himself and his all. “Thou shalt love the 
Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.” 

But the gates of heaven were closed in the sense that man simply could 
not make such a sacrifice. By his own power he is still incapable of it, for try 
as you may you simply cannot freely and fully abandon your life and being to 
God. This is that state and effect of original sin, of man’s characteristic and 


THE MEANING OF PRIESTHOOD 197 


congenital tendency to love himself rather than God. The Chinese have a prov- 
erb that aptly describes this condition: “When the wrong man uses the right 
means, the right means work in the wrong way.” If you start, then, by being 
the wrong man you are in a seemingly hopeless case, for whatever means you 
take to turn yourself into the right man will surely work in the wrong way. If 
you are by nature selfish, all your righteousness, all your efforts to love God 
and give yourself to him will have at their foundation a selfish motive. Like a 
fly stuck on fly-paper, the more you struggle to get off, the more firmly you 
will be stuck. 

This is a truth that all of us know well from experience. We know, for 
example, that worry is a sin involving lack of trust in God. We know, too, that 
it’s stupid to worry and that worry will solve nothing. But just try, by sheer will 
power, to stop worrying about something. Before you know where you are, 
you are involved in a perfectly horrible vicious circle, for you find not only that 
you can’t stop worrying, but that you are worried because you can’t stop, and 
that makes you doubly upset and nervous, so that you are alarmingly worried 
at worrying because you can’t stop worrying. 

Similarly, we know that in order to be possessed by God and to be one 
with him, we must let go of ourselves. Being fond of ourselves we hang on 
to them with all our might lest something should take them away, and slowly 
strangle in the process. So we know we ought to let go. We want to let go. 
But why? Because we are afraid of strangling ourselves. But you see, we are 
still afraid for ourselves, and in practice all our attempts to let go mean that we 
just hold on tighter. Thus when psychologists observe human virtue simply 
as human virtue, they come to the conclusion that altruism is merely indirect 
selfishness, repressed sexuality, or will-to-power, and thus prove to the hilt all 
that the Church has taught about original sin. When a human being attains 
enough self-consciousness to realize this predicament he becomes quite desper- 
ate. Some of the Apostles had experienced this despair. St. Paul’s epistle to the 
Romans is for the most part a discussion of this very problem, and according 
to the Book of Acts St. Peter raised it at the First Council of Jerusalem when he 
observed that it was quite impossible for men to obey the old law. This was the 
despair that underlay St. Augustine’s conversion, and prompted Luther’s revolt 
against the reversion of mediaeval Roman Catholicism to Judaic legalism—a 
revolt entirely justified however regrettable its excesses. 

God’s solution to this predicament is the Incarnation, the projection into 
time, space and history of his eternal disposition and action towards man. 
Because God is love and with his whole infinite being wills the union of each 
single creature with himself, man’s sin does not alter God’s nature but rather, 
from the relative human standpoint, intensifies the flow of the divine love 
towards him. In spite of the whole enormity of human sin, in spite of the 
pride whereby man would usurp God’s own throne—the center of the universe, 
God gives man that which he cannot earn, and performs in man and for man 


198 CHRISTIANITY 


that priestly action that man cannot do for himself. God gives himself to man 
in an eternal union from which even hell affords no escape, and there offers 
and sacrifices our human nature to himself to complete and consummate the 
bond. As an historical event the Incarnation reveals this truth to us in all its 
tragic and triumphant meaning. 

The creeds state plainly that in Christ God became man, not a man. The 
humanity of Christ is our own human nature, for as St. John says, coming 
into the world he enlightens every man. The Incarnation is local and historical 
to make it visible, and then to lead us on to the understanding that it is also 
cosmic and eternal—that it takes place not only at a distance from us in time 
and space, but also here and now, always, within us. In short, God is incarnate 
in your human nature; he has made the perfect offering of your human nature 
to the eternal Father on the cross; he has raised your human nature from the 
dead, and finally has carried up your human nature into heaven, into the inner 
life of the Holy Trinity. As St. Paul tells us in his epistle to the Colossians, we 
are already dead to ourselves, and our life “is hid with Christ in God,” for our 
real life is now Christ himself. 

This then is the meaning of the Atonement, the at-one-ment of God and 
man, the one perfect sacrifice that Christ as our High Priest came to perform. 
It cannot be stated too strongly. We have eternal union with God as a free gift. 
We do not have to make any sacrifice; we do not have to give ourselves to 
God—we have already been given. One thing alone remains for us to do, one 
power of the soul remains to be exercised that original sin has not destroyed—the 
power to say “Yes—Amen,” to give assent to what has been done for us. For 
we are carried along in an inescapable union with God as in a mighty torrent. 
We may swim against it, but we do not move against it; we are carried along 
just the same, but under protest. All we have to do is to turn around—repent. 
We can no more escape from union with God than we can escape from the 
present moment, and not only have we done nothing to deserve such a privi- 
lege, but almost everything to oppose it. The love of God is incomprehensible. 

The force of this truth has been somewhat hushed up by certain timid 
theologians who at any word of a given union with God are apt to throw up 
their hands in horror and scream, “Pantheism!” Be it therefore noted in passing 
that pantheism involves a necessary and automatic union of the creature with 
God, whereas Christianity involves an entirely unnecessary union that depends 
solely on the free and loving will of God. This is a far more exciting kind of 
union than pantheism can possibly conceive. 

From what has been said it should be easy to see what a vast difference 
lies between the priesthood of the old covenant and the priesthood of the 
new,—the one offering many individual and ineffective sacrifices, a human priest- 
hood, and the other embodying, affirming, pleading one cosmic and perfect 
sacrifice, a priesthood both human and divine. For the new priesthood is simply 
Christ extended; it is his High Priesthood realized in human persons just as, 


THE MEANING OF PRIESTHOOD 199 


in a wider sense, the whole Church is the Incarnation realized and extended 
in human persons. For the Church is the body, the fellowship, of those people 
who have accepted the gift of union with God that Christ is and that Christ 
brings. The Church is made up of those who have said “Amen” to the identity 
of their own humanity with Christ’s humanity, so that in a very real sense the 
Church is Christ’s Body. 

We saw that the Incarnation is cosmic and eternal as well as local and 
historical, for since the human mind functions chiefly on the local and histori- 
cal plane, it has to be approached on that plane. To get an abstract idea across 
to a child you must make it concrete, illustrate it with a story. Because God’s 
love extends to the whole human race, which is largely made up of very simple 
and childlike minds, he makes his eternal action concrete, and illustrates it in 
the story of Jesus. As the extension of the Incarnation, the church is likewise 
a cosmic and eternal organism as well as a local and historical institution, and 
herein lies its sacramental character. For a sacrament is a special instance of 
a cosmic and eternal action, a special instance of the union of God with the 
world. The ultimate object of the Incarnation and of the Church is to realize 
the union of the whole universe with God, for as the office hymn says: 


From the holy Body broken, 
Blood and water forth proceed; 
Earth and stars and sky and ocean 
By that flood from stain are freed. 


But its imperfect and finite nature makes it impossible for the human mind to 
grasp such a union all at once, and if we try to look upon everything as holy, 
it will shortly come about that nothing is holy. To enter into human conscious- 
ness holiness must be differentiated, localized, set apart. 

According to this principle, then, we have an organic series and system of 
differentiations, of special instances, of God’s loving gift of union with himself 
to the world—the Incarnation, the Church, the sacraments, the orders of the 
Church. It is by differentiation of function that an organism develops and mani- 
fests its powers, every function remaining, however, a property of the whole 
organism lest differentiation become disintegration. By virtue of her union 
with Christ the Church as a whole exercises the priestly office of Christ—the 
sacrificing, the offering and making holy, of creation. But for working purposes, 
that is, for sacramental purposes, this crucial function is differentiated into the 
sacred order of priests, which stands at the focal point of the Church’s life— 
the altar—and in the sacrifice of the Mass projects again and again into time 
and space the eternal sacrifice, dispensing also in Holy Communion the gift 
of union with God that it involves. The work of the priesthood, central in the 
Church, is the work of the Cross, central in the universe—the realization of 
union with God through Christ’s sacrifice. In short, the difference between the 


200 CHRISTIANITY 


old priesthood and the new is this: that whereas the old stood at the altar to 
offer his own and our personal sacrifices, the new stands to offer Christ’s that 
is both God’s and our own. 

The truth that the new sacrifice of the Mass realizes must not be mini- 
mized, and the whole work of the priesthood is to reiterate this truth—that in 
Christ God has offered our lives to himself and bestowed his own eternal life 
upon us here and now. The bread and wine set on the altar at the offertory is 
your own life and nature. Christ in and as his priest takes that human nature, 
makes it his own flesh and blood, and offers it perfectly to the Father. In Holy 
Communion it returns to you, enters into you, as the gift of union with the 
divine essence—not just as a dose of spiritual power to help you to be good 
through the coming week. The sanctity that should follow from this sacrament 
is an outpouring of appreciation and gratitude for the fact that God has given 
his eternal life to a wholly unworthy creature. 

From the gift of union with God flows the forgiveness of sins, and as 
the primary function of the priesthood is to minister the gift of union, so its 
secondary function is to minister forgiveness. For sacramental purposes, that 
is, for making things distinct, clear and simple to our concrete minds, the gift 
of absolution from sin is differentiated from the gift of union, Holy Penance 
is differentiated from Holy Communion, although the two are really one and 
are administered by one and the same priesthood. As our Lord’s exercise of the 
authority to forgive sins was perhaps his most outstanding claim to divinity, so 
his bestowal of that authority upon the Church is perhaps the clearest possible 
sign of the Church’s union with God, for God alone can forgive sins committed 
against him. Although the Sacrament of Penance normally precedes the offering 
of Mass in time, in the spiritual order it is derived from Mass. The confession 
of sins and the acceptance of God’s forgiveness is a way of appreciating, a way 
of saying “Amen,” to the gift that the Mass brings. A person who receives the 
Holy Communion without repentance and without accepting God’s forgiveness 
is not really and sincerely accepting Communion. You do not accept union with 
God unless you accept forgiveness from God, and you do not accept forgiveness 
unless you accept it concretely and realistically for your specific sins. 

The priest can say, “I absolve thee from thy sins” because he can say with 
Christ, “This is my Body.” For we are cleansed, not by our own repentance, 
but because we have been incorporated into Christ and offered by him to the 
Father. Repentance is the consequence of this fact; it is our appreciation of it, 
our response to the revelation of God’s unfailing love, apart from which “the 
continual dew” of his mercy falls off us like water from a duck’s back. The 
Prayer Book points out the essential unity of the two sacraments in the Prayer 
of Humble Access—“that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body, 
and our souls washed through his most precious blood.” The priest cleanses 
us from sin because he offers the sacrifice that effects forgiveness, though in 


THE MEANING OF PRIESTHOOD 201 


both instances he is the focal point of a function that belongs essentially to 
God incarnate in the whole Body of Christ. 

The third function of the priesthood is the ministry of the Word, and this 
again proceeds from the priest’s union with Christ. Once more, because he can 
say, “This is my Body” he can say, “This is my Gospel,” for in preaching and 
teaching the priest is to speak as Christ and to convey and explain the truth 
that inheres in his office. “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath 
anointed me to preach the good tidings to the poor.” The Christian priesthood 
involves also the prophetic ministry, and as there is a radical difference between 
the old and new priesthood, so there is a radical difference between the old 
and the new prophecy. 

Generally speaking the message of the old prophecy was one of judgment 
and wrath, and of exhortation to repentance. Sadly enough, the message of 
the Church must sometimes be the same. But that message will be of no effect 
unless a very definite primacy is given to the “good tidings,” for “God sent not 
his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him 
might be saved.” The priest’s authority to preach is not, therefore, to be taken 
primarily as authority to moralize. For so many hundreds of years clergy have 
moralized Sunday by Sunday, bombinating and fulminating from their pulpits like 
Amos and Jeremiah, that our people have by and large a thoroughly perverted 
and unbalanced notion of the Gospel, and that the Church simply stinks in 
the nostrils of the general and pagan public. If such harangues were adequate 
to win souls, Amos and Jeremiah would not have been succeeded by Christ. 

The priest’s ministry of the word involves not only public preaching, but also 
private teaching—in particular the individual direction of souls in the spiritual 
life: a task that any parish priest is liable to be called upon to perform, whether 
he is trained for it or not. How can we expect the Church to have any vitality 
at all (especially in this state of nervous fidgets called modern civilization) unless 
we set out definitely and systematically to develop the interior life? Direction in 
such a matter as this should surely be expected from the spiritual pastor of a 
community, but this has been so neglected that the interior life, so far as people 
have any at all, has become the special province of Christian Science practitioners, 
theosophists, swamis and psychoanalysts. Generally speaking, Roman Catholics 
relegate such matters to the cloister. Protestants, with the exception of Quak- 
ers, heed them not at all, and Anglicans occasionally get around to it. There 
cannot be any vital religion when it consists only of receiving the sacraments 
and getting some general edification on Sundays. There must be the daily life of 
prayer, and of prayer beyond the “Gimme-gimme-God-bless-Mother” stage. In 
the Church as constituted today it is an essential of the function of priesthood 
to be the source of direction and training in that interior life without which we 
can hardly expect any personal realization of union with God. Yet many, many 
churchpeople have no idea that the Church has any teaching on such matters, 


202 CHRISTIANITY 


and when they begin to experience the first stirrings of inner spirituality find 
in Unity* or Emmet Fox’ a more sympathetic voice than in their priest, from 
whom they expect only incomprehension and a few moral platitudes. 

The priest is elected to teach because the nature of his office is the central 
truth of the Gospel. The priest is the minister of Christ, the God-man, of union 
with God given to our humanity. And union with God he must teach, reveal- 
ing the length, the breadth, the depth and the height, the full and undiluted 
implications of God’s love. His teaching, as someone has recently said, must 
emphasize not ought but is—what God is and has done for man. An ought- 
message deflects our attention to ourselves and our own discouraging and 
uninspiring failures. But an is-message lifts up or minds to God. It is the same 
as when you are trying to read a rather difficult book. If you think, “I must 
try to concentrate, I ought to get on with it,” your attention is deflected from 
the words on the page to yourself trying to read them. 

Therefore in preaching, in the confessional, at the altar, the office of a 
priest is to lift up our hearts and minds and souls with Christ to the eternal 
Father, telling us that this lifting up is not a long, hard, agonizing journey to 
bring us to the verge of despair—but that, on the contrary, whether we know 
it or not, feel it or not, we are already lifted up because God has come down 
to earth and has ascended with us into heaven. “For I, if I be lifted up, will 
draw all men unto me.” Therefore, “my yoke is easy and my burden light.” 

That is why, in the confessional, it does not belong to the office of a priest 
to scold or to judge the degree of a penitent’s sinfulness. He is only to make 
sure that the person repents sincerely, and then by absolution and by counsel, 
if necessary, reveal the wonder of God’s love so that amendment of life may 
be inspired, not by shame, guilt or fear, but by gratitude. He is to remember 
the words of our Lord to the woman taken in adultery, “Neither do I condemn 
thee; go and sin no more.” 

So also, in offering Holy Mass at the altar, the priest’s whole action is 
theocentric, for he is to focus the mind of the congregation upon God and 
upon the gift that descends from him. Therefore the altar, not the minister, 
is the center of attention, and the priest must efface his own eccentricities 
of voice and gesture, making his own personal part natural, impersonal and 
unobtrusive so that he does not constitute a barrier and a distraction between 
the people and their God. 

While it is true that the function of priesthood belongs to the Church as 
a whole, it must be remembered that the Church is a dispensation of God’s 
love to all men both wise and foolish, rich and poor, exalted and lowly. The 
world’s work, the gathering of daily bread, has to be done, and this work has 
to be made an integral part of Christ’s Body since most people in the world 
are fully and necessarily engaged in it. Hence the vital function of sacramen- 
tal priesthood cannot be entrusted to all. The stewardship of the mysteries 
of God must not be entrusted to those who are perforce burdened with the 


THE MEANING OF PRIESTHOOD 203 


cares of the world, to more than ordinarily foolish human beings, or to those 
who would serve God much more ably by offering him in Christ some secular 
work. Furthermore, there are certain spiritual disadvantages in being a priest, 
for when you have to occupy your mind with formally religious considerations 
from one day’s end to another, it is not at all easy to be religious. You may have 
to talk about and think about religion so much that you have little energy left 
to practice it, and the practice of an incarnational religion must of necessity 
go beyond formally religious actions. I sometimes think it is more Christian 
to plant potatoes to the glory of God than to say so many formal prayers or 
offices. But the function of the priesthood is vital, because without formal, 
sacramental and localized religion, we might lose sight of religion altogether. 
That is a concession to human weakness. 

Despite, however, its disadvantages and temptations, and in virtue of its 
tremendous responsibility, the office of priesthood involves one supreme privilege. 
For the priesthood is something more than a merely expedient differentiation 
of one of the whole Church’s functions. Holy Order is a sacrament conferring 
upon its recipient a permanent and peculiar character. In Baptism, Confirmation, 
Communion, Penance, Matrimony and Unction the soul receives union with 
God in its various modes. But by ordination to the priesthood one becomes, 
in and as Christ, a giver of union with God to others. It is as if the baptized 
soul were a mirror reflecting the light of God’s love back to its source, and as 
if the ordained soul were also a window admitting the light. Every Christian 
ministers to others the love that flows from his union with God, but the priest 
ministers the union itself. This, then, is the meaning of that special union with 
Christ that the priesthood is said to have. It is not that priests are nearer to our 
Lord or more loved by him than layfolk; clergy who give themselves special 
airs as if they were the Lord’s elect are a very unattractive breed. The privi- 
lege of priesthood is simply to be able to have the joy of giving to others the 
supreme gift of the Incarnation—union with God and the forgiveness of sins. 
And if it is true that a priest is a priest for ever and has a special function even 
in heaven, I believe that function will be to share, not only in the joy of being 
able to see God, but in God’s own joy that the redeemed are able to see him. 

In this present time there is an urgent need for the priesthood to be true 
to its function, because in general the clergy are attempting to fulfill all kinds 
of functions other than that for which they were ordained, and as a result the 
glorious meaning of the gospel has been clouded. The primary function of 
God’s priest is not to be chief executive of a huge social-welfare organization, 
a keeper of public morals, an amateur politician, an adornment of drawing 
rooms and civic committees, nor yet to purvey an archaeological religion of 
ecclesiastical history and tradition garnished with unexplained and unthoughtout 
theological clichés. This kind of thing has reduced the gospel to such a piffling 
system of ethics with remote and unconvincing eschatological sanctions that it 
is no wonder that it arouses the barest minimum of enthusiasm. Enthusiasm 


204 CHRISTIANITY 


means to have God in you. Therefore the function of the priest is to minister 
the love of God to the world, and to proclaim that love not as a mere distant 
well-wishing but as the gift to each one of us, here and now, of union with 
God’s very self to all eternity. The closing words of our Lord’s High Priestly 
prayer in St. John’s Gospel give the essence of that work of priesthood, which 
is his and ours: “That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I 
in thee... . And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they 
may be one, even as we are one: | in them, and thou in me.”

CHAPTER FIFTEEN 


The Christian Doctrine of Marriage (1946) 


[ is impossible to understand any aspect of the Christian religion 
unless it is brought into immediate relation with the ultimate goal 
and purpose of the Faith, which is to say the final end to which human life is 
ordered. The supreme and all-important goal of our religion is God, for we 
have been created in order that we may realize an eternal union with our Cre- 
ator. The aim of the Christian religion is the eternal union of man with God 
in body, soul, and spirit. The Prayer Book relates Christian marriage directly 
to this end, for the preamble to the marriage service states that “matrimony is 
an honorable estate, instituted of God, signifying unto us the mystical union 
that is betwixt Christ and his Church.” In other words, Holy Matrimony is the 
highest earthly analogy of that creative union of God and man, Christ and 
Church, which is the end and fulfillment of human life. 

It is for this reason that Christian marriage has the dignity of a sacrament, 
that the Song of Songs is admitted to the books of Holy Scripture, and that our 
Lord constantly employed the symbolism of marriage to explain the meaning of 
his presence in the world. “Love your wives,” wrote St. Paul to the Ephesians, 
“as Christ also loved the Church, and delivered himself up for it, that he might 
sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of the water of life. . . . So also ought men 
to love their wives as their own bodies. . . . For this cause shall a man leave 
his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in 
one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak in Christ and the Church.” Thus 
to understand marriage we must study the union of man with God; and to

206 CHRISTIANITY 


Eternal life is the state wherein God and man are united in mutual life, 
so that man participates in the love that is between God and Father and God 
and Son, God the Lover and God the Beloved, sharing in its unutterable joy. 
“Every soul,” wrote Coventry Patmore, “was created to be, if it chose, a 
participator of this felicity, of ‘the glory which the Son had with the Father 
before the beginning of the world.’ ...He who has not attained, through 
denial of himself, to some sensible knowledge of this felicity, in reality knows 
nothing; for all knowledge, worthy of the name, is nuptial knowledge.” Our 
love for God, by means of which we deny ourselves and receive eternal life, is 
of course the reflection of God’s love for us. “This,” said St. John, “is love; not 
that we loved God, but that God first loved us.” For God takes the first step in 
our redemption by giving his very self, in Christ, to each and every member 
of the human race, for, in our Lord, God is uniting himself to the world. We 
accept this gift of union with God when we become members of his Church. 

This is a truth that cannot receive too much emphasis, not only because 
no aspect of the Christian Faith is intelligible apart from it, but also because 
it receives an absolute minimum of attention in modern Church teaching. We 
talk interminably of how we ought to love God and our neighbors, but say 
all too little of the infinite love that God has for us. We too easily conceal its 
immensity and infinity by speaking of it simply as grace, which the average 
layman understands simply as a handout of power from a distant deity, a dose 
of spiritual gasoline received at the altar on Sunday, sufficient to last until next 
week. We do not make it sufficiently clear that God’s love for us is precisely the 
gift of himself, that by grace we sinful men, through no merit of our own, are 
given nothing less than eternal union with the divine essence, the very Godhead. 
The Christian life, Christian morality, Christian sanctity, must be understood as 
the uproar of thanksgiving and gratitude for this overwhelming gift—not as 
the price at which we earn our pie in the sky. 

For by the power that the gift involves we can begin to love God in return, 
as a mirror turned toward the sun has the image of the sun within it and 
reflects the light back to its source. Our lord used this very symbol of sunlight 
to describe the Father’s love, who, as he said, “maketh his sun to shine upon 
the evil and the good,” for the divine love is like sunlight in that it pours itself 
out impartially in an act of pure generosity. It gives itself wholly and seeks no 
gain, for nothing can be added to the glory of God. Thus love, in the Christian 
sense of the word, means to give oneself wholly and unreservedly to another. 

But in common speech the world love can mean different things. Greek 
has two words for our one, and generally uses the term agape for the purely 
generous, self-giving love of God. With the other word, eros, it denotes a self- 
seeking love, loving something because it supplies that which you lack and for 
which you hunger. Because he lacks nothing, God’s love is always agape, but 
since human beings are imperfect and finite, not to say sinful, their love, apart 
from divine grace, is always eros. Man’s natural love for God, his thirst for 


THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF MARRIAGE 207 


divinity, which he has in spite of the fall, is thus also eros, and non-Christian 
religions, to the extent that they are purely natural religions, are religions of 
eros-love. But the true sanctity of supernatural religion is where man loves God 
with God’s own agape-love, exclaiming, to adapt the words of Job, “Though 
he slay me, yet will I love him!” For the Christian’s love of God is a sharing in 
Christ’s love for the Father, the self-abandoning and self-emptying love of the 
cross, which is only possible for the Christian because he is one with Christ. 

The distinction between agape and eros explains, too, the difference between 
Christian marriage and purely natural marriage, for the natural love of man 
and woman is eros-love. But because a Christian, by virtue of union with God, 
is capable of agape-love, marriage between Christians is a relationship in which 
the natural love of man and woman is transformed into the supernatural, the 
self-seeking type of love into the self-giving. 

Now this transformation of natural into supernatural love is not just the 
addition of some extra cream to the cup of marital bliss. On the contrary, it 
is something without which the relations between man and woman, husband 
and wife, are problematic, troubled, and fundamentally unworkable. In com- 
plete variance with secular opinion, the Christian doctrine of marriage assumes 
that, because of the fall, the natural relations of man and woman, whether 
monogamous, polygamous, or wholly promiscuous, are in a thorough mess. 
This is no arbitrary theological disgruntlement with the joy of life; it is a strictly 
realistic and scientific observation. Ever since history was written, the relations 
of man and woman have been problematic through and through. Look at this 
modern world that ceases not day and night to praise the joys of natural love, 
and that goes on seeking them so greedily just because it doesn’t find them. 
The true commentary on the modern praise of natural love is the concomitant 
popularity of easy divorce and that staggered polygamy, which subscribes to 
the frustrating and perpetually disappointing creed that the grass on the other 
side of the fence is always greener. If this is not enough evidence, one need 
only turn to the literature of all ages for immense and reiterated witness to 
the fact that natural love is at root unhappy and frustrated love. The world’s 
classic love stories—Tristan and Isolde, Heloise and Abelard, Romeo and Juliet, 
Orpheus and Eurydice, to mention a few from the Western world alone—are 
essentially stories of frustrated love, for they reflect the experience of the race. 

The Christian sacrament of holy matrimony is not given to the world to 
deny or to trim the joys of natural love to a minimum. The fact that must be 
drummed into the secular mind is that Christian marriage is the only alternative 
to frustration, the only realistic cure for the diseased condition of natural mar- 
riage, the only form of essentially happy love. It is not that Holy Matrimony 
entirely abolishes the problems of marriage, but rather raises them to a level 
where they become fruitful and redeeming instead of frustrating and damn- 
ing, where, like the pains of the cross, they have an undertone of essential 
and absolute joy. 


208 CHRISTIANITY 


At root the Christian doctrine of marriage is quite simple. Its essence is 
that Holy Matrimony is constituted by two baptized persons entering into 
the marriage contract and living together as man and wife. Because they are 
baptized they are one with Christ and partakers of the divine nature and the 
divine love. Thus the love that they have for one another must be a degree of 
agape, God’s own love, for which reason their union is analogous to the union 
of God and the world in Christ. Such is the basic principle upon which the 
whole structure of the doctrine depends. It has two primary consequences. 

The first is that Holy Matrimony is a state in which the man gives himself 
wholly to the woman, and the woman to the man, for in the Christian agape 
sense love can mean nothing less than this. Christian marriage is therefore 
monogamous and permanent. It is monogamous because the love of one 
partner for the other is whole and undivided. Only God, being infinite, can 
give himself wholly to many objects. It is permanent, “til death do us part,” 
because to give oneself wholly in love means that you give not only what you 
are now, but also what you will be; you give your whole life, both as it expands 
in space and in time. Furthermore, you give yourself unreservedly. You burn 
your bridges behind you; you commit yourself irrevocably and leave no way of 
escape. If this is rash and foolish, it is none other than the foolishness of that 
love that showed itself on the cross. For unless you are prepared to do this you 
do not really love, and if you have the divorce-court in the back of your mind 
as a way of escape your marriage is not likely to work for the simple reason 
that your love is incomplete. It is not Godlike love. For the marriage vow to 
live as one flesh “for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in 
health,” to stay by your partner come what may, is precisely a reflection of 
the love wherein God unites his very self with us to all eternity even though 
we elect to be damned. 

The second consequence may sound more simple than it is: namely, the 
object of one’s love in the state of Holy Matrimony is another person. The 
real reason for the failure of natural love is that its object is not really another 
person; it is oneself—projected upon another. Eros is self-love; it is the love of 
the sensation, the emotion within oneself that another person arouses. In essence 
natural love is to be in love with the state of being in love. The other person is 
merely the occasion for this state. “Eros,” writes Denis de Rougemont, “treated 
a fellow-creature as but an illusory excuse and occasion for taking fire.” Agape, 
on the other hand, is outgoing and extraverted; its object is that other unique 
human person, and is more often a reflection of the creative love of God who 
gives himself entirely to each one of a multitude of unique beings who are 
quite other than himself. 

The keynote of Christian marriage is therefore wholeness, which is after 
all the same word as holiness. It is the product of a love in which the lover 
gives himself wholly to all of the beloved, not a mind, not a soul, not just a 
woman in the abstract, but that totality of aspects and qualities that adds up 


THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF MARRIAGE 209 


to a unique human being. The result of total love is total union, the becoming 
of one flesh, analogous to the realization of eternal life, the goal of religion, 
wherein we are one life with God. 

So much for the theoretical considerations that lie at the root of the Chris- 
tian doctrine of marriage. We turn now to their practical application, as I wish 
to show that this is the only workable and practical philosophy of marriage, 
and not just a highly specialized and select vocation for super-mystics. We must 
therefore consider the application of agape-love to the three great aspects of 
marriage as of man—the three departments that make up the totality of human 
life: the realm of body, the realm of mind, the realm of spirit. For marriage, 
like religion, is a bodily, mental, and spiritual union of lover and beloved. Just 
as a religion without sacraments is like a marriage without physical love, so a 
marriage without communion of mind and spirit is like a purely ceremonial 
religion—mere “spikery.” 

We shall begin, then, with marriage as bodily union. In the popular view 
this seems to be the all-absorbing phase of marriage, for it regards marriage 
and sex as some people regard bread and butter . . . mostly butter. Important 
as the sexual aspect of marriage may be, in reality it occupies a very small 
fraction of one’s married time, and cannot without complete detriment to 
itself be isolated from or set above the other aspects of marriage. So many 
marriages fail for the very reason that sexuality is regarded as an end in itself, 
in ignorance of the fact that, apart from Christian love, sex—like everything 
else in a fallen world—is a failure. 

The Church does not teach, and churchmen should not give the impression, 
that sex is evil or even a necessary evil. Read your Old Testament. On the con- 
trary, evil is purely spiritual in origin, and sex, like all other material processes 
and things created by God, is positively good. In common with eating, sleep- 
ing, moving and thinking, it is a faculty that becomes evil only when misused. 
The Church does teach that sex becomes a source of evil when separated from 
agape-love, and love in that sense implies a marriage. This is, again, no arbitrary 
restriction based on the assumption that what is very pleasant is wrong. It is 
a simple statement of fact, of the fact that without total self-giving love the 
sexual relation is a failure—even on the purely biological plane. 

Contrary to the general belief of mankind, the successful sexual relation- 
ship does not come naturally to human beings. So far from being a thing to 
which any mature person can take “as a duck to water,” sexuality is a high 
art that must be acquired through devotion and discipline like any other art, 
such as painting or music. Strange to say, many church people find this quite 
an unfamiliar and sometimes repugnant idea. They are accustomed to thinking 
of sex as pertaining to the realm of indecency and toiletry, and have no notion 
at all that it can be supernaturalized. Needless to say, such thinking is wholly 
vicious and heretical—for if sex is not supernaturalized it becomes at once an 
occasion of evil, and it makes no difference whether you praise it to the skies, 


210 CHRISTIANITY 


or degrade it to the mud. Both are forms of the same error. Christian marriage 
alone provides the conditions under which the art of sexuality can be practiced 
to perfection. However, it is unlike other arts in that almost everyone desires 
to practice it, and desires it fervently. Failure in the attempt to practice it thus 
involves serious and wide-spread frustrations, and it is in these that the real evil 
of misused sex has its origin. This evil consists in the obsessions, fantasies and 
perverse desires to which sexual failure will so often give rise. 

Four conditions, all of which are involved in the Christian concept of mar- 
riage, are necessary for the perfection of the art: 

1. No art whatever can be called perfect without this first condition, which 
is that it be done for the glory of God. A Christian is one who tries to do 
every single daily action for the glory of God, turning his whole life into an 
act of worship. Sexuality must not be excluded from this worship, for as much 
as anything else it is done in the eyes of God and will become evil unless 
dedicated to him. Wherever the danger of evil and temptation lurks, its physi- 
cal occasion must be offered to God. There is no other escape from sin. But 
where sex is concerned this is too often the very last thought that will occur, 
even to the otherwise devout. 

2. Self-giving love implies that in the sexual act one must put the pleasure 
of the other partner before your own. Unhappily our American Prayer Book 
has omitted the phrase that accompanies the giving of the ring in the English 
Prayer Book, “with my body I thee worship.” The natural idea of sexual pleasure 
is the reverse—“with thy body I me worship”—and when this is the motive the 
act will not be sexual communion at all, but simply self-gratification. Generally 
speaking, this will mean lack of complete satisfaction for the female partner 
in particular (her reactions being slower than the male) because the man bent 
purely on self-gratification will approach the act with thoughtless haste and 
clumsiness. To overcome this he must have a degree of genuine altruism found 
only in agape-love. Similar haste and selfishness on the part of the woman, 
though more rare, will have the same effect. 

3. The sexual life of the married couple must have creative issue. (I say 
“the Sexual life,” because this cannot be said of each sexual act—quite apart from 
the question of artificial contraception.) It must have creative result just as the 
union of man and God, if it is to be realized at all, must have creative result: 
by their fruits ye shall know them, and every tree that beareth not fruit is cut 
down and cast into the fire. Save in certain abnormal circumstances, childless 
marriage denigrates into a selfish “twosome,” which, for lack of creative outlet, 
comes to grief by its own futility. It lacks analogy with God the Creator. Since, 
too, the sexual act is always liable to produce children, it cannot be entered 
into with the necessary relaxation and self-abandonment if there is any anxiety 
as to its results. Only the security of permanent marriage can fully get rid of 
anxiety and its attendant frustration of pleasure. 


THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF MARRIAGE 211 


4. As in all other arts, the art of prayer or the art of the piano, it is essential 
that there be constant and regular practice—with the same partner. It may take 
from five to seven years to reach a real degree of perfection, to attain the full 
adjustment between two unique and highly complex human organisms—an 
adjustment that can never be attained if relations are promiscuous. Like temper- 
ance, sexual self-control must not be confused with abstinence. A controlled 
pianist is not one who plays the piano very seldom; he is one who plays it very 
often and very well. He will, of course, get tired and stale if he plays too much, 
but the trouble with so many married couples is not that they have too much 
intercourse, but too much undisciplined and selfish intercourse. The notion that 
sexual self-control is merely a matter of longish periods of abstinence proceeds 
from the same fallacy as sexual promiscuity—that ideal relations are normal and 
natural. They are not; they are supernormal and supernatural. They necessarily 
involve the total devotion and self-denying love of the other partner, which is 
the essence of Christian marriage. For such love and such discipline-in-the-act 
are only possible for one who has realized some measure of union with the 
sole source of unselfish love—almighty God. 

The absence of any of these four conditions brings in frustration, making 
the act somewhat disappointing, somewhat below expectations. People can 
react to such frustration in one of two ways: they can go on practicing and 
loving until perfection is reached, or they can retire into the realm of fantasy, 
and simply dream about an easy and readymade perfection. The latter course 
opens the door to every kind of sexual evil, because these fantasies soon grow 
to the point where pleasures are imagined that reality can never provide. 
Attempts may be made to fulfill such dreams in all kinds of promiscuous and 
perverse relations, but because of the absence of our four conditions these 
relations will always involve more and more frustration, giving birth to more 
and more impossible dreams. That way lies sexual obsession that is a hell on 
earth, destroying character and spiritual life. 

Our teaching about sexuality in Christian marriage needs to stress above 
all that the Church’s view, so far from being designed to curtail the joys of 
physical union is the only really workable approach to the subject. A fully 
enjoyable sex life may occasionally have been lived but as a rule simply is not 
found apart from the principles of Christian marriage, because the Church’s 
view is based on the actual facts of nature and the human spirit. Perhaps this 
is a bold statement, but the evidence is that wherever these principles are not 
followed, an atmosphere of obsession prevails upon the subject of sex, which 
is a clear sign of frustration. As St. Thomas insisted over and over again, the 
principles of the spiritual life do not destroy nature: they perfect it—and it is 
for lack of this perfection in the realm of sexuality, and consequent lack of real 
enjoyment, that our modern world, obsessed with the impossible dreams of the 
frustrated, wallows greedily but unhappily in the sins of the flesh. 


212 CHRISTIANITY 


But the real problems of marriage do not lie so much in physical union as 
in mental and spiritual union. It is a truism that one must marry even more for 
companionship than for physical attraction, but sometimes I think a truism may 
be defined as a principle that all know and few observe. So few young people 
seem to realize that the real work of marriage is to learn to live in the same 
house, in the same room, with another person day after day, year after year, 
on terms of such great intimacy. Because of this, the adjustment of sexuality 
is far less difficult than the adjustment, the union, of tastes, interests, minds 
and characters. As the psychiatrist C. G. Jung once observed, marriage is a task 
for adults only, and unfortunately there are so few of them. 

To approach this problem on the merely natural level is surely quite absurd, 
and it is small wonder that in countries where the Christian religion does not 
flourish a union on the mental and spiritual plane is seldom even attempted. 
When the old wife gets boring, put her away in a quiet corner of the harem 
and get a new one. For heaven's sake don’t mix the women up with your social 
life; make it a tabu to take them out to dinner, and when company comes lock 
the door to their quarters. And when all else fails, use the big stick. Lacking a 
supernatural religion all this is very understandable. But our modern problem 
is this: that 2,000 years of Christianity have abolished this kind of marriage 
management in the Western world, yet because that world has largely for- 
saken Christian belief we now have millions of married pagans trying to live 
in Christian monogamy. No wonder they call it monotony. 

I submit that without extraordinary luck or extraordinary grace, it is prac- 
tically impossible to live on terms of such prolonged intimacy with another 
person on any other basis than agape-love. No amount of mere compromise 
will effect the necessary adjustment, for compromise assumes that marriage is 
a 50-50 relationship where I have my rights and you have yours, so let’s make 
a bargain. But there is nothing of the 50-50 compromise about Christian mar- 
riage. “The wife,” says St. Paul, “hath not power of her own body, but the 
husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but 
the wife.” In Christian marriage you give yourselves 100 percent on both sides, 
for like all the sacraments of the Church Holy Matrimony is a sacrificial action. 
Nowhere is sacrifice more necessary in marriage than in the achievement of 
the union of souls, for outside of a monastery there is surely no more rigor- 
ous school for the denial of one’s personal pride. How often must you admit, 
when it comes to a difference of opinion, that you are quite wrong; how often 
must you eat your most cherished prejudices; or how often must you submit 
patiently to a black atmosphere when, for conscience’s sake, you have had to 
insist on a point of view? And yet anyone who has consistently done this over 
the years knows that it leads to a happiness that those who will not sacrifice 
never can experience. 

On the whole, it would seem that in our civilization it is harder for men than 
for women to let go of themselves and give themselves to the extent required in 


THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF MARRIAGE 213 


agape-love. We all know, for example, that it is much easier to interest women 
in religion than men, because a woman is much better adapted psychologically 
to yielding herself. But Anglo Saxon-American man is afflicted with a certain 
psychological and spiritual rigidity that makes it most difficult for him to give 
himself entirely whether in religion or in marriage. In marriage this difficulty 
is encountered more particularly on the mental and spiritual level. The trouble 
lies in a certain false masculine pride that causes men to avoid like the plague 
certain things considered “undignified” and still more things considered “sissy.” 
All too often this is taken to such lengths that men wholly stifle the feminine 
element in their own nature, and thus destroy all common ground and sym- 
pathy with women. In short, the cult of the “strong, silent man” all too easily 
becomes the neurosis of psychological isolation and the sin of spiritual pride. 

First, this attitude is destructive to marital union in the realm of work. 
American men in particular are guilty of becoming so absorbed in business, 
of making business so much the end-all and the be-all of their lives, that their 
wives are excluded almost entirely from their husbands’ principle interest in life. 
In a civilization of commuters this is a major gulf between man and wife, and 
it is not helped a bit when, on coming home to dinner, the man is disposed to 
be strong and silent about what he has been doing all day. 

Second, it is destructive of marital union in the sphere of recreation, which 
might otherwise compensate for inevitable lack of union in work. But what 
happens? Ousted from a share in her husband’s major interest, the wife, in 
self-defense, goes in for that monstrosity called “Womens’ Club Culure,” where 
she is segregated off from the males with her female cronies. American culture 
is thus a predominantly female culture, whence it is not surprising that men 
consider the whole cultural and aesthetic side of life “sissy.” They avoid it, 
and once again lose common ground with their women-folk. This recreational 
segregation of the sexes does not only arise in the realm of the highbrow arts, 
but also in that of the lowbrow games. It is with his male friends, rather than 
with his and their wives, that the average man takes his recreation, his golf, 
his poker, his fishing. 

Third, it is most of all destructive of marital union in the realm of worship. 
The average American husband and wife simply do not go to Church together 
nor have any spiritual life in common in the home. They must face the facts. 
Either God exists, or he doesn’t. If he does, he is the most important reality in 
life, and a marriage that is not united in God leaves the marriage unconsummated 
in the major realm of human existence. But, here again, to the ordinary male 
religion is “sissy.” From one standpoint he is right, for since the Reformation 
both Protestant and Catholic piety have gone on the “mushy” side. But from 
another standpoint he is quite wrong, since Anglo Saxon-American man could 
well do with a great deal less toughness and a great deal more suppleness; it 
would make him much more of a real man, and less of a neuter oaf. It is up 
to the Church, however, to teach the strength of suppleness and the power 


214 CHRISTIANITY 


of yielding. “Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth.” Under the 
burden of snow, the branches of the willow bend and do not break, whereas 
the rigid limbs of the pine crack and fall. 

This so-called marriage wherein husband and wife neither work together, 
play together, nor worship together, and very soon cease to sleep together, is 
an all too common feature of American society. Jiggs and Maggie' are very true 
to life, and I do not doubt that Maggie enjoys herself at the Club, and that 
Jiggs has a wonderful time with the gang. But such happiness as they have is 
precisely an escape from marriage, and in real life the insatiable appetite of eros 
will look for satisfaction from all kinds of impossible and harmful sources. And 
the perpetual frustration of this appetite tells its tale in the steely eyes and tight 
lips of our hardened clubwomen, and in the early deaths or nervous collapse of 
men who seek their escape in the squirrel-cage of modern business—which goes 
faster, to save time, to make money, to go faster, to save more time, to make 
more money, until something or someone busts. No one can pretend that on 
this basis, either marriage or the escape from marriage works—or that it makes 
anyone happy. But people go on doing it, on the supposition that a couple of 
kids who are more or less congenial at the age of twenty will somehow get 
along naturally if thrown together in marriage. This, however, is not marriage; 
it is juxtaposition. Marriage is an action, a work, in which one partner gives 
his body, mind, and spirit to the other. 

In the Christian view, therefore, a marriage simply is not Holy Matrimony 
unless it is a physical union, a mental union, and a spiritual union, for anything 
less than this is not a wedding of two entire persons. I believe that before the 
clergy bless a marriage they should consider whether the couple are actually 
whole persons, or whether the grace of Matrimony has any chance of making 
them so. To let a woman of the Church, for example, be married to a man who 
once received Holy Baptism but has never done anything about it since, is just 
as disastrous as letting her marry someone with a serious physical deformity 
such as an undeveloped head. We shall be a thousand times more respected 
by the world if we have the courage of our convictions and boldly declare 
that a person with no spiritual life, no interest in agape-love, is simply not all 
there. He is no fit recipient for the sacrament of Holy Matrimony. If the state 
can refuse a license on the relatively trivial grounds of a positive Wasserman 
reaction, the church can surely do the same on the grounds of much more 
serious spiritual diseases. 

Doesn't it all boil down to this: do we believe in the Christian religion we 
talk so much about, or don’t we? Do we believe that God exists, that human 
nature is fallen, that God has given himself to each one of us in Christ, that 
because of the fall natural marriage is a necessary failure, and that because of 
Christ, and only because of him, marriage, and all that goes with it can be made 
healthy, whole and holy? Do we believe it? If we honestly don’t we shall help the 
human race far more by becoming devout Hedonists and making the best of a 


THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF MARRIAGE 215 


bad job, of an incurably evil human existence. But if we really do believe that 
Christ, that this God of love is Reality itself, more actual than these hands, these 
bones, more concrete than these very walls, more solid than this earth—then 
we are utterly bound to admit and state plainly that those who live their lives 
without relation to this Reality are more diseased, more crippled, than the blind, 
the deaf, and the dumb, more remote from reason than the insane. But God, 
through us his Church, can heal them, and it for the work of healing that his 
sacraments are given to the world for all willing to try them and accept their 
conditions. We need, then, to teach Holy Matrimony not merely as an ideal, a 
duty, a godly, righteous and sober way of life, but rather as a dispensation of 
the divine mercy for the healing and transfiguration of what must otherwise 
be inevitable frustration and bitterness—the passion of human love.

can't talk to you about worship unless I first give you some idea of 

my own religious point of view. I want to be quite frank with you 
so that there shall be no misunderstanding. I do not belong to any standard 
brand religion. I don’t have any religious label because in this day and age, when 
we know so much about the various religious points of view of the whole 
world, I consider it to be unintelligent to commit oneself to a particular label. 
This is prejudice. This is saying I commit myself to a certain point of view in 
advance of any new discovery, any new knowledge that may turn up. To me 
the essence of faith is being open-minded. I would say that there is a funda- 
mental contrast between belief on the one hand and faith on the other. Belief 
comes from an Anglo-Saxon root, lief; which means to wish. In my definition, 
a believer is one who fervently hopes that the nature of the universe is thus 
and so. He is therefore committed. He is using religion as something to hang 
on to. And when you use religion as something to hang on to, you are in an 
attitude that is the exact opposite of faith. 

For example, when you are thrown in the water and it is necessary to learn 
how to swim, the very last thing you must do is to grab hold of the water 
and try to stay afloat in the water in the same way that you try to support 
yourself on the dry land. The commitment of faith is very much like being 
thrown into the water because you suddenly realize that you don’t know. You

is. Therefore, you have to act as the swimmer, to let go. Take another example. 
When a cat falls out of a tree, the cat lands safely because it makes an act of 
faith. If when the cat let go, it suddenly stuck out its limbs like this and said, 
“e-e-a-h,” the cat would hit the ground and be a bag of broken bones. But all 
cats have learned from their mothers to relax when they fall, to let go so they 
land with a soft thud. And that is the act of faith. 

Faith I would say is having one’s mind open to the facts or the truths, 
whatever they may turn out to be. Therefore, from my point of view, religion 
is not a doctrine to be believed in; it is an experience. That is to say, it is an 
experience in just the same sense that being alive is something that you experi- 
ence, that falling in love is something that you experience, that being afraid or 
being happy or whatever is an experience. So for me, religious faith or religious 
knowledge is that alteration that occurs to one’s consciousness, to one’s whole 
being, indeed, as soon as you take an attitude toward life that is fundamentally 
one of letting go. In Buddhism, for example, the highest state of conscious- 
ness is called Nirvana, and a lot of people think that that means nothing at all, 
annihilation. The word in Sanskrit means “blow out.” While the breath is life, 
if you hold onto your breath you begin to lose it. So, you see, he that would 
save his life, his breath, shall lose it, but he that loses his life shall find it. Let 
go. Let the breath go. Let go of God. 

In a certain sense—and I don’t want you to think I am an irreligious per- 
son—there are two kinds of irreligion, the higher and the lower. The lower 
irreligion we all know about—when one simply doesn’t care about these things. 
The higher irreligion could be called atheism in the name of God. There was 
once upon a time, though everybody’s forgotten it, a technical Christian theo- 
logical term for this. It was called apophatic theology or the via negativa, and 
its great proponent was a certain saint who goes by the name of Dionysius 
the Areopagite. The idea was this: that the most dangerous of all idols are 
not the idols made of wood and stone, but the idols made of imagination and 
thought. Therefore, all ideas of God, all conceptions of God that are fixed and 
positive and formal are idols. The truly religious man of faith must be one 
who smashes his own idols, or if I may put it another way, he scrapes from 
the window the paintings of the sun and the blue sky that have been put on 
the glass. He looks as if he were destroying something but actually he’s letting 
the real light in. So, in my philosophy, all conceptions of God to which people 
cling for spiritual security are their major obstructions to faith and to religious 
knowledge, and the best thing to do is to get rid of them. 

Now this applies particularly to ideas, to concepts, that might very well be 
mistaken for the reality that they represent. The ideas of God as the “necessary 
being,” or as the “undifferentiated aesthetic continuum” or as the “infinite absolute 
mind,” are far more dangerous idols than say De Lawd of Green Pastures. De 
Lawd of Green Pastures wears a top hat and smokes a cigar, and this is not a 
dangerous idol because nobody would dream of taking it seriously. In the same 
way, the good old-fashioned God who has a beard and sits on a golden throne 


WORSHIP IN SACRAMENT AND SILENCE 22.1 


is not in danger of being taken seriously by any intelligent person. But at the 
same time, there is something marvelous about these images just because they 
will not be taken seriously, and because they are also very expressive. 

It is very difficult to conceive a being in higher terms than in human terms. 
Once you have tried to conceive God as something like “necessary being” or 
“pure spirit,” you get a conception of God that is rather more like an infinite 
sea of tapioca pudding than anything else. Whereas to think of Him in the 
form of men is to think of Him in the highest form that we know, provided 
you have this little thought in the back of your mind, what the Germans call 
hintergedanke—a little thought, a little reservation—that this isn’t really the way 
it is. (This is the essence of mythological symbolism. Mythological symbolism 
is very powerful and very necessary.) So when I speak of God in anthropomor- 
phic human terms I do so with a twinkle in the eye so that you won't take me 
quite seriously. Nevertheless there is something to be said, there is something 
to be conveyed by this message. 

Now, having abandoned all religious believing, I want to tell you from my 
own experience what happens. In order that you can understand it, I have to 
express what happens to you in some sort of mythological terms. They are 
better, they are clearer than attempting to be aridly philosophical. (I could put 
it to you in that way too, but I’m not going to tonight.) Now what I come to 
is this: the fundamental nature of the universe is based on the game of hide- 
and-seek, or lost-and-found, or peek-a-boo; the universe as we know it physically 
consists of a sort of now-you-see-it, now-you-don’t sort of thing, something like 
the positive and negative aspects of electricity, the up and down of the wave, 
the here-we-are and the here-we-aren’t of a discontinuous vibration. We know 
things exist because they just don’t stay put; they keep coming and going. For 
example, if I put my hand on your knee and leave it there, you will soon cease 
to notice it, but if I keep patting you on the knee you will keep knowing that I 
am there. In the same way, here in front of me is a hard object, a microphone. 
The reason it’s hard is that it keeps going out of existence and coming back 
into existence so that my fingers won't go through it just as I can’t put my 
finger through the rapidly evolving blades of an electric fan. This microphone 
is going much faster than any electric fan. My finger is going pretty fast, too. 
All of those electrons or whatever they are, waves or wavicles, go b-r-r-r the 
whole time; and b-r-r-r is here-we-are and here-we-aren’t. You can also test this 
out by playing with a baby. The game that all babies like is when you hide 
your face and the baby starts to giggle. That’s because the baby in its unspoiled 
state is profoundly in touch with the metaphysical core of the universe. So, 
that’s the fundamental game. 

Now, suppose I were God, what would I do? Let me put it to you in a 
simpler way. Suppose that every night you could dream any dream you wanted 
to dream, what would you do? I am sure we would all spend many nights 
having wonderful wish-fulfillment dreams. When we had got through with 
enormous meals and dancing girls and concerts and great gambols, we would 


222 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


then go into adventures and thrills. But when we had gone through that for 
several months, we would decide we wanted a surprise dream where we didn’t 
know what we were going to dream. First of all a pleasant surprise, several 
months of pleasant surprises. Then we'd have the adventure of an unpleasant 
dream, knowing that we would wake up in the end. In reality, we do that all 
the time, because when we go to plays, when we read books, we like to know 
the fundamental plot. Everything starts out O.K.—status quo. Then a villain has 
to come in and upset everything and, although we know it’s a play, we still sit 
a little bit on the edges of our chairs, especially if the play is well acted. We 
go through the thrill of seeing everything go to pieces and then everything is 
restored again. So, if you were the Lord God, what would you do? 

Well, of course, you would have imaginary things going on. You would 
imagine a creation, and you would imagine after a while that you weren't in 
charge of the creation anymore, that you were mixed up in it. That would 
be like having a surprise dream, or like the perfect technological push-button 
universe in which everything we desire can be had immediately by pushing a 
button. Five minutes of that would be enough. We'd have to have a button 
labeled “surprise.” So you might say the Lord is the supreme dramatist who 
forgets that he is the Lord: he goes through the game of pretending that he’s 
all of us; he becomes involved like a great actor in myriads of parts; and he 
gets absorbed in them because he’s such a good actor that he takes himself 
in. He has himself sitting on the edge of his throne absolutely spellbound. Is 
it going to come out all right? 

You see, there really are only four great philosophical questions. Oh, I think 
there may be five. The first one, “Who started it?” The second, “Are we going 
to make it?” The third, “Where are we going to put it?” The fourth, “Who’s 
going to clean up?” and the fifth one, which I just thought of, “Is it serious?” 

Now from the ordinary religious point of view, from what I call the point 
of view of standard brand religion, it is serious. The Lord is a very serious 
person as we shall see shortly. But in the view that I have come to the Lord is 
not serious, because the Lord’s fundamental function is play. Just as Shakespeare 
says, “The play is the thing.” The whole universe is in this sense dramatic. (I 
am not trying to preach to you; I’m just telling you what I think.) The whole 
universe is dramatic. It’s a drama that’s so good that it takes itself in and looks 
as if it isn’t play. It looks as if it’s serious, but it isn’t. And the reason it isn’t 
serious is that basically every one of you—although you may not know it, and 
most of you probably don’t—every one of you is really the Lord in disguise, 
and you are therefore fundamentally “what there is.” You're it. See the game 
of hide-and-seek. You’re it. So there’s really no need to worry; that’s the 
fundamental attitude of faith. You don’t need to hang on to God or to cling 
to God, because the moment you do so you deny the fact that you're it. By 
trying to have faith you don’t have faith. By trying to believe, you aren’t really 


WORSHIP IN SACRAMENT AND SILENCE 223 


religious because the fundamental thing in religion is to realize oneness with 
or union with God. 

Now I don’t attempt to say what I mean by God, I'll just give you the 
idea of the old gentleman on the throne, because the real thing you couldn't 
think of any more than you can bite your own teeth or look straight into your 
own eyes without a mirror. In this sense, you see, none of us knows who he 
is because each one of us is the absolutely fundamental root and ground of 
being. Now some people will object to this idea. They'll say it’s pantheistic. 
That’s a dirty word in theological circles, because it’s supposed to disrupt all 
morals. After all, if I’m God, and you’re God and everybody’s God it really 
doesn’t matter what happens. And when we say it doesn’t matter, that’s a way 
of saying that matter is no matter. It really doesn’t amount to anything because 
it’s a game, a good game, a wonderful game. In that sense it matters—a glori- 
ous game—but it is only a game. 

Here I find a difficulty. The moment you try to root ethics and morals in 
the nature of God you get into trouble. The Chinese have a proverb: “Don’t 
swat a fly on a friends head with a hatchet.” In the same way, if you make 
good and bad and moral behavior depend on God, it’s too much. It overwhelms 
things. It’s saying that the distinctions between good and evil are so eternal 
that the good people will be happy forever and ever, but the evil people will 
have to scream in hell forever and ever. And that’s really very immoral. There’s 
nothing more immoral than making morality absolute. We know what good 
grammar is, and we all agree fairly well to speak proper English. But we don’t 
have to say that English is the one, authoritative, true, absolute language. So 
we get much better agreement on speaking English than about moral behavior 
just because we don’t put such heavy sanctions on it. We don’t swat the fly on 
the friend’s head with a hatchet. 

I feel that a schizophrenic universe in which there is an infinite gulf between 
the creator and the creature is an unthinkable and absurd system. It’s as if—and 
many people feel this—it’s as if the universe were primarily a whole lot of 
things, a sort of cosmic flotsam and jetsam that happened to gather together 
from nowhere. Whereas I like to think of the world the other way around. For 
example, I like to think of it as a star that radiates from a center, where all the 
differences in the world are linked in a fundamental unity. Just as petals come 
out of a flower, as rays from a star, as legs from a spider, as tentacles from 
an octopus, as spines of a sea-urchin, all of us are the many, many functions 
and doings of one center. Then I feel I have an integrated universe, a whole 
universe, and thus a holy universe. 

Now, then, if we take this point of view as fundamental, what is the place 
of worship? You might say in this kind of religious philosophy there is no place 
for worship because worship as most of us understand it is kowtowing. Histori- 
cally, most forms of worship in the West—Jewish, Christian, and Islamic—are 


224 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


based on the idea of the behavior of a subject in the courtroom of a monarch. 
Here the monarch sits on his throne, and everybody who comes in bows or 
prostrates himself. Why do people prostrate themselves? A monarch is a person 
who is fundamentally afraid. For if you take the world in hand to govern it 
by force, you must be frightened since everybody will be trying to take the 
power from you. So when you come into the presence of an absolute monarch 
he has his back and his throne against the wall, his guards on either side, and 
everybody prostrates himself because in that position they can’t attack. And 
so it is with worship in Christianity, as we have known it in the past, whether 
Catholic or Protestant. 

This form of worship is exactly what goes on in the court of a king. 
Indeed, the great cathedrals are sometimes called basilica because that is the 
place of the king. There is the throne, very often behind the high altar where 
the representative of the monarch, the representative of the Lord of Heaven, 
the bishop, archbishop, or pope or whoever he may be, sits, and the ceremonial 
is based on the court ceremonials of Roman and Byzantine emperors. In the 
Protestant churches, the scene is not very different. It’s republican rather than 
monarchical since the protestant church is modeled after a court of justice. 
The presiding person doesn’t wear royal vestments. He wears the black gown 
of a judge. There are boxes and stall and a pulpit. You get behind a stall to 
protect you from the people, just in the same way as the judge. But still it’s 
based on a court scene. Both of these forms of worship presuppose that God 
is something not in us but above us. Even if in some sense he is within us, 
he is above us. And, although he may be within us, we have to worship him 
externally. Actually, we’re turning things around to worship that which is in us 
but not us—not fundamentally us—but always infinitely other. 

This is an attitude suitable to human beings who have been bamboozled 
into being afraid. Thus, when they hear the thunder they cower a little; they 
think about their guilty conscience and wonder if the lightning is going to hit 
them. But this is an attitude suitable to childhood, and perhaps it may not 
even be very suitable to childhood. But it is a childlike attitude, or rather, a 
childish attitude, bowing down to authority not realizing that you yourself are 
the source of that authority. If you say, “I believe in the Bible or the Church 
because I’m told to do so,” your belief is an act of obedience. Don’t kid your- 
self. But it was your choice to obey, wasn’t it? You give to whatever you believe 
such authority as it has for you. So you may say that Protestants interpret the 
Bible in their own way. Catholics interpret the Bible as they’re told to. And 
therefore they’re more obedient. But that’s not true because they consented to 
it in the first place. It was their choice to accept the authority of the Church, 
which interprets the Bible. So it is fundamentally on your authority that you 
assent to any kind of religious doctrine and belief. 

Now if there could be some form of worship that is relating oneself com- 
munally—all worship is fundamentally something we do together—relating 


WORSHIP IN SACRAMENT AND SILENCE 225 


ourselves communally to the heart of the universe, something that is concen- 
tric with the real heart in every one of us, what would the pattern of such 
worship be? We’re thinking in symbolism. The old pattern of worship was the 
courtroom, and the thing we all look at is down at the end, whether it is the 
altar or the preacher. But a worship that represents God in everybody would 
be radial. I recently went to France and visited many of the great French cathe- 
drals. In almost every one of them they have moved the altar to the middle of 
the cathedral. Instead of being far up at the East end, it’s right at the crossing. 
And when the mass is celebrated, the congregation now stands the whole way 
around the altar, and the priest is in the middle. What does this mean? What’s 
happening? Maybe the dear old church is waking up. Perhaps it is. 

Now I offer a rather daring proposal that in some places is not accepted. It 
is the idea that the act of Christian worship, the mass, the Holy Communion, 
the Lord’s Supper, or whatever you want to call it, is not something you go 
to see like you go to see a movie. It’s something in which you participate. It’s 
not something you hear or witness; it’s something you do. For example, in 
the Eastern Church, the church of Greece and Russia, they don’t say, “to say 
mass”; they say, “to make the liturgy.” To make it. Poiein in Greek means not 
only to make, to do, but also is the root word for poetry, the act of creation. 

For a moment may we consider the meaning of this fundamental act of 
worship in Christianity? Its possibilities for an altogether new feeling of worship 
are very important. I want to consider it from two points of view. First of all, 
the original action of Jesus in being with his intimate disciples before he was 
crucified and instituting what was for those people in that time an absolutely 
outrageous ceremony. He took the bread and broke it and said “This is my 
body.” Then he took the cup and said “This is my blood of the New Testament, 
which is shed for you and for many for the remission of sins. Drink it.” Now 
you couldn’t say anything more startling to a Jew because the one supreme 
taboo for the Jew was that you mustn’t drink blood, for blood is life and the 
blood belongs to God alone. When an animal is killed, the blood is poured upon 
the ground as an offering to the Lord. Jesus was saying, so to speak, from now 
on drinking the blood signifies for each one of you your oneness with God. 

From the second point of view, all life is maintained by eating and drinking. 
Bread is ground wheat. Wine is crushed grapes, fermented. Upon the sacrifice of 
the wheat and the grapes depends our life. We are killing something, whether 
it be vegetables, cows, chickens, turkeys or what not. We are all killing some- 
thing in order to live. Each one of us, deep down in his heart, has probably a 
profound sense of guilt for living only at the expense of other life. So when 
Jesus said “This is my blood which is shed for you for the remission (the putting 
away) of sins,” it means this: Don’t feel guilty anymore that you have to drink 
the grapes and eat the crushed wheat, because all that you eat is me, and I’m 
offering myself to you and it is my pleasure. I am the one you kill when you 
kill the cow, and I give myself to you because I am before Abraham was. I am 


226 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


the way, the truth, and the life. I am, therefore, that disguised godhead in all 
beings whose sacrifice is the act of playing that I am not God, but that I am 
all creatures. I dismember myself in the beginning of the creation, and after 
a time I remember myself. Hence, do this in remembrance of me. In other 
words, as the scattered grain is brought together in one loaf, we are made to 
realize that we are all one body. “I am the vine and you are branches,” and 
the “I am” is the central “I” in every one of us. 

Now let’s look at that analogy further. First of all, it is no longer the 
analogy of the creator above and the miserable little creatures like subjects of 
the king below. Instead, it is the vine, the tree, the central stem and all the 
branches coming out from it. Secondly, the basic idea of traditional Christian 
worship is not that it is man talking to God, addressing petitions, and so on, as 
if one were to present himself in the court of the king and say, “Your majesty, 
your humble subjects request that you do so-and-so for us.” The very idea of 
the liturgy of the mass of the Holy Communion as being the central act of 
worship shows something quite different. Actually, Christian worship is based 
on the notion of God as Trinity, as a cycle of love. In worship, that aspect of 
God, which is called the Father loves the Son through the Holy Spirit, so that 
there is a cycle of love going on. Christian worship was originally intended 
to be man getting caught up in the cycle like you might catch something 
in a vortex of a whirlpool. So the worship of God is not what man does to 
God, but what God does to himself through man. Thus, for example, when 
Benedictine monks recite the psalms in what they call the Divine Office, they 
have the idea that the words of the song are the words of the Holy Spirit, not 
their own personal words. When they sing the songs, the Holy Spirit is talking 
through their mouths. All worship thus originates in God and returns to God. 

In the Christian philosophy, therefore, worship would be defined as God’s 
love for himself through man in which man is like the flute, the reed that is 
played upon by the wind of the spirit. So you can see that already there is, in 
germ, the idea that worship is radial. It is not something done to something 
over there out there. It is not the confrontation of I, man, with Thou, God, 
because where do these things that confront each other come from? Where 
do these opposites originate? From somewhere way off? No. The secret is 
that all opposites, all poles are two ends of the same thing. You can’t even 
arrange a meeting between things that are really opposite; you can’t even get 
them together. But in the poles lies the secret of opposites. We don’t know 
black without white; we don’t know light without darkness; we don’t know 
long without short; we don’t know infinite without finite; we don’t know 
being without nonbeing. That means that there is a secret conspiracy between 
them—to look different, like Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Before all diversity 
there is unity. Before all differences there is agreement. We must agree in order 
to differ. There can’t be a battle between the tiger and the shark. They have 
no common ground, no common field. 


WORSHIP IN SACRAMENT AND SILENCE 227 


What should be the kind of worship that truly expresses the radial view 
of the cosmos as distinct from the confrontational view? To be frank with you, 
I was once a clergyman. | gave it up because it didn’t suit my temperament. 
I was a little bit too much of a bohemian, and also I just couldn’t preach at 
people. It went against the grain. But when I was a clergyman, an Episcopa- 
lian chaplain at Northwestern University, I used to say to the students: “Now 
look here, nobody is allowed to come to church here out of a sense of duty. 
We don’t want skeletons at the banquet. If you feel that you ought to come to 
church, stay in bed on Sunday morning. But if you'd like to come, please come. 
For I announce that there will be a celebration of the Holy Communion, and 
I mean a celebration.” 

What are we doing here fundamentally, despite all the agony that the 
crucifixion represents on the surface, what is deep down here is the joy of 
the celebration. For it is written in the book of Proverbs that God with divine 
wisdom creates the universe by playing. Wisdom speaks and says, “I was playing 
before him, playing in the world, and my delight was with the sons of men.” 
Of course, the King James version, which is rather a pompous translation, says 
“Rejoice.” But the correct Hebrew is “play.” So the whole notion here is that 
worship is making celestial whoopee. 

In the Christian mythology—and I don’t use the word “myth” disrespect- 
fully, but simply as any idea expressed in images rather than abstract terms—in 
the Christian mythology, what are the angels doing in heaven? What is the end 
of man? They say it is the Beatific Vision. To behold God. Well, what’s the 
good of that? But, if God is “the Which than which there is no whicher,” then 
when you are there, you're there. There’s nothing else to do, so all the angels 
call out, “Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.” Alleluia doesn’t mean anything. It’s just as 
if you were so crazy with happiness that you went wh-e-e-e-e-e. All you could 
do was just shout for joy. 

So from this point of view, God is that which is perfectly useless. Not good 
for anything at all because he is perfection, and there is nothing else that it serves, 
no greater ends to which it leads, absolutely of no consequence whatsoever. 
No consequence. That’s what a Buddhist means when he says that the highest 
state is freedom from karma. It is of no effect anymore. It isn’t a cause-effect 
scene. It isn’t leading to something because it’s already there. You've arrived. 
And so in this way, all profound worship is a celebration of having arrived. It’s 
where we join hands and dance. 

For dancing is very profound. When you dance, you are not going anywhere. 
You are not aiming at a certain spot on the floor. When you play music, you're 
not trying to reach the final bar, for if that were the point of music, the best 
musician would be one who played the fastest, gets there first. There would 
thus be pianists who would specialize in playing only final chords. 

If life is anything like music, it has no aim to get anywhere. But we are all 
hypnotized, especially in western civilization, into the idea that life is supposed 


228 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


to get somewhere. The result is that when we do get where we think we’re 
going, we don’t enjoy it, because we are then thinking about getting some- 
where else. A person who lives for the future is never living in the present, so 
he never gets anywhere. It’s of no use for him to plan for the future because 
when he gets there he can’t enjoy it. 

The idea of centrality, this whole radial idea I’m talking about, is to know 
how to be “all here.” It’s a definition of sanity. Nobody can be sane, really sane, 
unless he preserves a central area in his life for craziness, that is, for perfect 
uselessness, for “whoopee,”—for absolutely nothing except blub-blub-blub-blub. 
That’s the touchstone of sanity. The difficulty with most people, especially when 
they make a religious scene, is that they’re too rigid. 

You know what happens to an absolutely rigid bridge. When the wind 
blows it breaks. A strong bridge has to have a little bit of give in it. It’s like 
the movement of the hips in dancing—a little bit of swing. And if you don’t 
have that, you’re nutty as a fruitcake. You’re insane and you'll fall apart; you'll 
break down. You have no faith; you have no give. So that worship that cor- 
responds to the Sabbath—remember, that’s the day on which the Lord didn’t 
do any work, and said, “Holiday!” Holy day—which is a day for laying on the 
law, for rationality, for listening to sermons, and that’s just terrible. Instead, a 
church should be a place where people go out of their minds for a while and 
have a great celebration. The idea of the bread and wine is that this is the 
most friendly thing imaginable. Get a little bit drunk—not too much—and 
have good bread. It’s very difficult to get good bread nowadays, because it’s 
all made out of ticky tacky. That’s a combination of paper maché, plaster of 
Paris, and plastic glue; it comes in any flavor. That’s a sign of how remote our 
culture is from fundamental Christian ideals. For in Christianity, material is very 
important. “God so loved the world... .” And that means honest bread and 
things like that. Good wine had body to it. But we are trying to get everything 
disembodied. Eventually, we'll just take some pills and that will be that; it’s 
almost that way now. 

In this fundamental idea of worship, the spirit and the flesh are together, 
and the flesh is seen as the rays, the doings, the activity of the spirit. It is a 
coming-together in a spirit of celebrating the fact that we are all branches of 
one vine; that the real deep-down inmost self in us all is the dancer of the 
worlds, as the Hindus think of the Lord as the great juggler with many arms. 
Imagine the God with ten arms, each hand juggling ten balls and each ball a 
galaxy. “Is he going to make it”? We watch with terror this act of juggling. 
Then suddenly he drops one, and everybody covers his eyes and says “Oh-oh.” 
There’s an immense explosion. We think it’s the end, but we look again, and 
suddenly we see all the fragments of that broken ball have turned into ten more 
gods with ten arms juggling ten balls each. “Good old Shiva,” we say, “he did 
it again.” This alternation of terror and suspense, suddenly bursting into joy, 
is the systole and the diastole of being. 


CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 


Western Mythology 


Its Dissolution and Transformation (1970) 


hen at the service of Morning Prayer a priest of the Church 
of England addresses himself to the origin and foundation of 
the Universe, he will usually make the following statement: 


Almighty and Everlasting God, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, the only 
Ruler of Princes, Who dost from Thy Throne behold all the dwellers 
upon Earth, most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy favor to behold 
our sovereign lady Elizabeth the Queen and all the royal family. Endue 
her plenteously with heavenly gifts, health and wealth, long to live, etc. 


This is obviously the language of a professional flatterer in court. For the 
most basic model or image of the world that has governed Western civilization 
has been the idea of the universe as a political monarchy, and this is something 
extremely troublesome to citizens of the United States, a country in which we 
are supposed to believe that a republic is the best form of government. But an 
enormous number of our citizens believe that the universe is a monarchy and, 
obviously, if the universe is a monarchy, monarchy is the best form of govern- 
ment. Thus until quite recently you could not be a conscientious objector to 
fighting in a war unless you solemnly declared that you believed in a Supreme 
Being from whom your orders came, and therefore from a higher echelon of 
command than the President of the United States.

This proved to be difficult for people who declared themselves to be Bud- 
dhists or Taoists who do not believe in a Supreme Being in that sense, although 
I did advise many conscientious objectors that when the lawmakers put in 
words “Supreme Being,” they were trying to find a vague phrase rather than 
to define a kind of theistic belief. In 1928 the British Parliament was called 
upon to authorize a new prayer book for the Church of England. They didn’t 
authorize it because they found it too “high church.” But in the course of the 
debate, somebody got up and said, “Isn’t it sort of ridiculous that this secular 
legislative body should be asked to rule upon the affairs of the Church because, 
after all, there are many atheists among us?” And another member got up and 
said, “Oh, I don’t think there are any atheists here. We all believe in some sort 
of something somewhere.” And so, I suppose the phrase “the Supreme Being” 
means some sort of something somewhere. 

The foundation of common sense behind a great many of the laws and 
social institutions of the United States is a theory of the universe based on the 
ancient tyrannical monarchies of the Near East. Such titles of God “King of 
Kings” and “Lord of Lords” were in fact titles of the Persian emperors. The 
Pharaohs of Egypt and the lawgiver Hammurabi provided a model for thinking 
about this world. For the fundamental idea that underlies the imagery of the 
book of Genesis, and therefore of the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian traditions, 
is that the universe is a system of order that is imposed by spiritual force from 
above, and to which we therefore owe obedience. In this idea there is a complex 
of subideas as follows: 

(1) That the physical world is an artifact. It is something made or con- 
structed. Furthermore, this involves the idea that it is a ceramic creation. In the 
book of Genesis, it is said that the Lord God created Adam out of the dust of 
the earth, and having therefore made a clay figurine, he breathed the breath of 
life into its nostrils and this clay figurine became the embodiment of a living 
spirit. This is a basic image that has entered very deeply into the common sense 
of most people who have lived in the Western world. Thus it’s quite natural 
for a child brought up in Western culture to say to its mother, “How was I 
made?” We think that that’s a very logical thing to ask, “How was I made?” 
But actually this is a question that I don’t think would be asked by a Chinese 
child. It wouldn’t occur. The Chinese child might say, “How did I grow?” But 
certainly not, “How was I made?” In the sense of being constructed, being 
put together, being formed out of some basic, inert, and therefore essentially 
stupid substance. For when you take the image of clay you don’t expect ever 
to see clay forming itself into a pot. Clay is passive. Clay is homogenized. It 
has in itself no particular structure. It’s a kind of goo. And therefore if it is to 
assume an intelligible shape, it must be worked upon by an external force and 
intelligence. So you have the dichotomy of matter and form, which you find 
also in Aristotle and therefore later in the whole philosophy of St. Thomas 
Aquinas. Matter is a kind of basic stuff that becomes formed only through the 


WESTERN MYTHOLOGY 231 


intervention of spiritual energy. This has been, of course, a basic problem of 
all our thinking—the problem of the relationship between mind and matter. 

For how can mind exercise influence upon matter? After all, all good ghosts 
walk straight through walls, and if a ghost in its passage through a wall does 
not disarrange the bricks how can the ghost in the machine, the ghost in the 
body, lift an arm or move a head? This has been a fundamental problem for 
Western thought because we have made this distinction between the unintel- 
ligent brute matter and the intelligent active spirit. 

In much of our philosophy of art, in the West, we have thought of the 
work of the artist as that of imposing his will upon an intractable medium. 
The sculptor beating stones into submission to his will. The painter taking inert 
oils and pigments and making them conform . . . and so many of our sculptors 
and painters feel all the time that the media in which they work are intractable, 
and that they can never quite get it across because the physical, material, and 
therefore in some way diabolical nature of the media always resists the vision 
that the spirit wants to represent. Even such a great historian of art as Andre 
Malraux speaks of this tension between the vision of the artist, his will and 
his technique, and the base, material intractability of the medium. So, also, in 
everybody’s everyday common sense we think of the world, the material world, 
as being a sort of amalgam of clay, of matter that is formed. We might even be 
so strangely depraved as to think that trees are made of wood. Or mountains 
made of rock in the same way as this podium is made of wood by a carpenter, 
and perhaps it is not insignificant that Jesus was the son of a carpenter as well 
as being the son of the Architect of the universe. Obviously a tree is not made 
of wood. A tree is wood. A mountain is not made of rock. It is rock. The whole 
point of western science to understand the nature of the physical world was 
originally, of course, a quest to find out what is the basic material and beyond 
that, what is the plan, the design, in the mind of the maker? 

At this time, Western physics has abandoned the question, “What is mat- 
ter?” because of the realization that you can describe physical processes only in 
terms of structure, in terms of form, in terms of pattern. You can never say 
what stuff is. Whenever a scientific description comes in the form of an equa- 
tion, say a + b = b +aor1 + 2 = 3 everybody understands what it means. 
It’s a perfectly intelligible statement. Without anyone having to say what “a” 
signifies, what “b” signifies, or one-what, two-what, or three-what. The pattern 
itself is sufficient. For it is the understanding of modern physics that what is 
going on in the world, what we are, is simply pattern. Imagine, for example, 
a rope in which the first three feet are made of hemp, the second of silk, the 
third of cotton, and the forth of nylon, and you tie a knot in the rope, a simple 
granny knot, and you move the knot along the rope. The material of the knot 
keeps changing but the pattern of the knot remains the same. In just this way, 
each one of us is recognizable as an individual by virtue of being a consistent 
pattern of behavior. Anything that could be described as our substance, that 


232 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


is to say, the milk, the water, the beefsteak, etc., that composes us (for we are 
what we eat) is constantly changing, and anything that could be considered as 
a kind of component stuff of our bodies is always passing through, but today 
you know your friend of yesterday, because you recognize a consistent pattern 
of behavior. So what science studies, what science now describes, is simply pat- 
terns. But the average individual has not yet recovered from the superstition 
that underneath patterns, inside patterns, there is basically some kind of stuff. 
For when we examine anything we see first of all the pattern, the shape, and 
then we ask the question, “What is the shape composed of?” So we get out 
our microscope to look very carefully at what we thought was the substance 
of, say, a finger. We find that the so-called substance of the finger is a minute 
and beautiful design of cells. We see a structure, but then when we see these 
little patterns called individual cells, we ask again, “What are they made of?” 
and that needs a sharper microscope, a more minute analysis. Turning up the 
level of magnification again, we find that the cells are molecules but we keep 
asking, “What is the stuff of the molecules?” What we are in fact discovering 
through all of this is that what we are calling “stuff” is simply patterns seen 
out of focus. It’s fuzzy, and simply fuzziness is stuff. Whenever we get fuzziness 
into focus, it becomes patterns. So there isn’t any stuff, there is only pattern. 
This world is dancing energy. 

Though this is the point of view of the latest scientific thought of the 
West, it is not the average person’s common sense. This is not yet the image 
in terms of which individuals make sense of the world, and that is my defini- 
tion of “myth.” Myth, not meaning falsehood, but in a much deeper sense of 
the word, is an imagery in terms of which we make sense out of life. When 
somebody is trying to explain electricity to the nonscientific laymen, he uses, 
say, the imagery of water, of how water flows, and he explains, through water, 
which the laymen understands, the behavior of electricity that the layman does 
not understand. Or an astronomer in trying to explain the nature of curved 
space will liken the construction of space to the surface of a balloon on which 
there are white dots. As you inflate the balloon, the dots get further and further 
away from each other, and this is somewhat like the expanding universe. He 
is using an image; he’s not saying, “The world is a balloon;” he is saying, “It’s 
like a balloon.” So in, of course, the same way, no sensible theologian ever 
said that God is literally the father of the universe—that God is a cosmic male 
parent—but that God is like a father. This is analogy. But the image always 
has a more powerful influence on our feelings than abstract and sophisticated 
ideas. Therefore the image of God as the political king, the authority father, 
has had a vast influence upon the emotions and feelings of Christians, Jews, 
and Moslems throughout many, many, centuries. But in the course of time it 
became an embarrassing image that had to be abandoned, for nobody wants to 
feel that he is watched all the time by a judging authority however beneficent 
his intentions may be. You well remember when you were children in school, 


WESTERN MYTHOLOGY 233 


sitting at your desks writing some sort of composition or performing a math- 
ematical exercise, and the teacher would sometimes wander along behind you 
and look over your shoulder to see what you were doing. Nobody likes this. 
Even though you respect your teacher very much you don’t want to be watched 
while you are working. So the idea that we are constantly observed by one 
who knows us through and through and judges us is profoundly embarrassing; 
we simply had to get rid of it. Thus there came about the “Death of God,” 
that is to say, the death of that particular idea of God. For it was substituted, 
in the course of the development of Western thought in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries, a different model of the universe, which had, however, 
continuity with the model of the universe handed down to us through the 
Holy Scriptures and the Christian tradition. 

Let me remind you that the model of the world, the world made by God, 
was basically an artifact, a construct, a mechanism, and therefore something 
governed by law. All processes in the universe were looked upon as operating 
in obedience to the word of God. For as it says in the Bible, “By the word of 
the Lord were the heavens made and all the hosts of them by the breath of 
his mouth.” In the beginning was the Word . . . so 


There was a young man who said, “damn!” 
For it certainly seems that I am 

A creature that moves 

In determinate grooves: 

I am not even a bus, I’m a tram. 


The whole quest for knowledge in the Western world was to ascertain 
the laws, the Word, which is laid down in the beginning and which is obeyed 
by all living processes. If we could understand the word of God, we could 
predict the future. Much, therefore, of the Scriptures, especially of the Old 
Testament, consists of books of prophecy written by those who had heard 
the word of the Lord and who knew what was going to happen. This is the 
foundation of Western science. The idea of prophecy, of prediction, because 
if you know the future, you can prepare for it and control it. But at the same 
time this also contains within itself a kind of nemesis, because if you know 
the future, the one thing the future tells you for certain is “death and taxes.” 
Especially death .. . you are going to die. You are going to come to an end. 
The future can only be successful for a while, but in the end comes the doom, 
unless you can project that, by supernatural intervention, beyond the doom, 
the inevitable decay of all physical forms, there will be a resurrection of the 
body. Death follows from the inherent intractability and stupidity of matter. 
The spirit cannot finally conquer matter and all the things that we create out 
of our clay will fall apart, because the formlessness and heaviness of matter 
will overcome it. But we project beyond this the hope that spirit will in the end 


234 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


be more powerful and will be able to miraculize matter and make it immortal. 
The idea of the resurrection of the body involves the transformation of matter 
into everlasting life. 

That is the technological enterprise of the West. That is what we are 
after. All technology, especially in medicine where we now transplant hearts, 
is trying to make matter subservient to the will, to spirit, and to immortalize 
it. But is that what we really want? I think that on entrance to college every 
student should be obliged to write an essay called “My idea of Heaven,” and 
it would be emphasized that he had to be extremely specific and really spell 
out in most particular terms what it is that he wants. Blow the expense, forget 
practicalities, what would you like to have? What would your greatest ideal 
of pleasure be? It might well be that if we thought that through, we would 
not want immortality of the individual personality. We might find that, in the 
end, it would turn out to be a horrible bore. But ordinarily we don’t think 
these things through. I’m fascinated with all the various kinds of imagery of 
heaven, with what people would expect it to be like. But they only touch on it, 
they never go into detail. People go into much more detail about the imagery 
of hell; that’s been worked out in very fine detail. All the tortures have been 
specified. But of the imagery of heaven we just say, “Oh, it'll be great. We'll 
have streets paved with gold, harps to play,” and children get disgusted right 
away. “Do you mean that after we’re dead, we’re gonna have to be in church 
forever?” Well, that’s horrible! Look, too, at the religious art of the Western 
world. I think particularly of the painting by Jan Van Eyck, The Last Judgment. 
Above there is heaven, below there is hell. Heaven is a solid mass of people 
sitting in pews, a row of heads like cobblestones on a street. They’re looking 
very demure and just sitting there, and below . . . wowee! The squirming mass 
of writhing bodies all naked and erotic being eaten up by serpents, presided over 
by a bat-winged skull. Hell is something to look at! Heaven isn’t. So, somehow 
or other we don’t think through what we think we desire. As the proverb says, 
“Be careful of what you desire, you may get it.” 

We had, then, to get rid of this image of God as the autocratic ruler 
because it was very uncomfortable. But we justified this by making a still more 
uncomfortable image as a sort of rationalization. We began to feel belief in 
a universe that cares about us, in a “ground of being” that is personal and 
interested in us. This is woolly and wishful thinking. It was all right for little 
old ladies and perhaps as a story for children, but tough-minded people, to 
borrow a phrase from William James, faced the facts and the facts are that the 
universe does not give a damn about human beings or any other species. It is 
a completely mindless mechanical process whose principles are to be explained 
by analogy with the game of billiards. This was, of course, the model upon 
which Newton thought about the physical world. In line with Newton, Freud 
thought about the physical world in terms of hydraulics—psycho-hydraulics is 
basic to Freud’s thinking—the idea of the unconscious as a river that can be 


WESTERN MYTHOLOGY 235 


damned up and the dam has to be controlled in some way because the river 
is also mindless. It is also called libido, and that means “blind lust.” Likewise 
Ernst Haeckel thought of the energy of the world as blind energy. It was all 
mechanical, and our second great model of the world, which I shall call the 
fully automatic model, was a carryover from the Judeo-Christian model; it was 
an artifact, and thus a machine, but the artificer and the controller, the personal 
God, had disappeared, and you were simply left with the mechanism. 

Now in this scheme of things the human being was regarded as a fluke, 
a statistical fluke, as when you have a million monkeys working on a million 
typewriters for a million years, the chances are that at some point they will 
type the Encyclopaedia Britannica. But the human being regarded as a fluke is 
not really very different from the human being regarded as the product of a 
divine whim. God is very whimsical in the book of Genesis. Suddenly he cre- 
ated great whales. Like that! He looked at them, and saw that they were good. 
He didn’t know that they were going to be good, but when he saw what he 
had done he said, “That’s okay. I approve of it.” There is always that kind of 
fluky feeling. Thus the belief that you are a fluke in a mindless, mechanical 
gyration is, as a matter of fact, what most people believe today. 

We have very few religious people in the Western world because most 
people really do not believe in Christianity even though they may be Jehovah’s 
Witnesses. What they feel is what they ought to believe, and they feel very 
guilty because they don’t really believe. So they preach at each other and say, 
“You really ought to have faith,” but don’t really believe it because if they did 
they’d be screaming in the streets. They’d be taking enormous full page ads 
in the New York Times every day, and having horrendous television programs 
about the Last Judgment. But even when the Jehovah’s Witnesses call at your 
door, they’re quite courteous. They don’t really believe it. It’s simply become 
implausible and what everybody does in fact believe is the image of the fully 
automatic model, that we are chance gyrations in a universe where we are like 
bacteria inhabiting a rock ball that revolves about an insignificant star on the 
outer fringes of a minor galaxy. And, after a while, that will be that. When 
you're dead, you’re dead. It’ll be over. In our ordinary, everyday thought and 
common speech, we use such phrases as, “I came into this world,” or we could 
quote the poet Housman saying, 


I, a stranger and afraid 
In a world I never made. 


There is a sense of somehow not belonging. Of course, if you are a fluke, 
in that sense you don’t belong. Likewise, if you are an incarcerated spirit from 
a spiritual world quite other than this material world, you don’t belong. There 
is in most civilized people’s common sense the feeling that you look upon this 
world as something outside you, foreign to you, alien to you, and so we natu- 


236 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


rally say, “You must face the facts. You must confront reality.” The “Existential 
Encounter!” The truth of the matter is that you didn’t come into this world at 
all. You came out of it, in just the same way that a leaf comes out of a tree 
or a baby from a womb. You are symptomatic of this world. 

Thus if you are intelligent (and I guess we just have to assume as a leap of 
faith that human beings are intelligent) you are symptomatic of an intelligent 
energy system, just as Jesus said that one doesn’t gather figs from thistles or 
grapes from thorns. So also you don’t gather people from a world that isn’t 
peopling. Our world is peopling just as the apple tree apples, and just as the 
vine grapes. We are symptomatic of an extremely organized and complex 
environment. You do not find an intelligent organism in an unintelligent 
environment in exactly the same way that you do not find apples growing on 
cottonwood trees. Isn’t it curious then, that, especially in the nineteenth cen- 
tury, when the prevailing philosophy of science was called scientific naturalism 
(involving repudiation of the notion that the world was governed by external 
and supernatural intelligence) that people calling themselves naturalists began 
to wage an unprecedented war on nature. The naturalists were those who 
thought nature is stupid, and therefore that if the values and the intelligence 
of mankind are to persist, we must beat nature into submission to our wills. 
We thus initiated a form of technology whose basic premise was that man 
must dominate rather than cooperate with nature. Our technology has been 
motivated by a hostile spirit whose two great mythological symbols are the 
space rocket and the bulldozer. 

The space rocket is, quite obviously, a phallic symbol, and a hostile phallus. 
This has something to do, I suppose, with our sexual inadequacies. A phallus 
in the biological sense is not a weapon at all; it is a caressing instrument. The 
whole idea of the phallus is to give a woman ecstasy, and perhaps a baby. It’s 
not to pierce her as if it were a sword. Thus the proper conception of a rocket 
should not be to conquer space . . . but could you possibly imagine the idea of 
giving pleasure to space, or our going out into space to confer love and delight 
upon any other beings that may be out there, and to fertilize naked planets? 
In the same way the symbol of the bulldozer is to make a horrible fulfillment 
of the biblical prophecy that “every valley shall be exalted and every mountain 
laid low and the rough places plane,” an attitude of pushing the world around. 
It is therefore absolutely urgent for our survival that we put behind technology 
a completely new spirit and attitude. This is not an antitechnological attitude. 
It is not saying that science is a ghastly mistake, but that what we need is not 
less science but more. We need more and more study and understanding of 
our complex relationships to and dependence upon plants, insects, bacteria, 
gases, astronomical processes—and the more we understand how our existence 
is one process with the existence of all these other creatures and things, the 
more we can use technology in an intelligent way, regarding the world outside 
of ourselves as simply an extension or part of our own bodies. 


WESTERN MYTHOLOGY 237 


But the transformation of Western mythology must involve yet another 
step. We have been through the political image of the universe as ruled and 
dominated by an essentially violent lawgiver. Incidentally, all preaching, the 
whole organization of our churches, is violent, it’s military. In Paradise Lost 
Milton described what was going on in heaven before Lucifer even thought 
of rebelling. There were armies with banners and all the heraldic emblems of 
battle and force. Who’s looking for trouble? Think of all the imagery that we 
love in our churches, of how many people have a heartthrob when they sing the 
hymn “Onward Christian Soldier?” And the “Cross of Jesus, going on before,” 
the military banner. In hoc signo vinces. But the military model of imposing order 
upon the world by violence hasn’t worked, and the whole history of religion is 
the history of the failure of preaching. Preaching only makes hypocrites, people 
imitate righteousness because they are afraid of the wrath of God, or afraid 
in a more sophisticated way of being unreal or unauthentic persons, which is 
the new version of going to hell. It doesn’t work. The fully automatic model 
doesn’t work either, because that is simply another form of hostility. It’s saying 
“Tm a real tough guy because I face the facts, and this universe is just a stupid 
affair, and if you're a realistic fellow, you're going to face it, see? If you want 
to believe in God, or that something cares, you’re just a sentimental old lady. 
This is a tough thing, see? The more I believe that the universe is horrible, the 
more it advertises me as a tough personality, facing the facts.” 

But somehow more in line with twentieth-century science would be an 
organic image of the world, the world as a body, as a vast pattern of intelligent 
energy that has a new relationship to us. We are not in it as subjects of a king, 
or as victims of a blind process. We are not in it at all. We are it! It’s you. 
Every individual in this organic myth of the world must look upon himself as 
responsible for the world. You can’t look back at your parents and say, “You got 
me mixed up in this, damn you!” In juvenile courts, children who have learned 
a little about psychoanalysis can say, “It’s not my fault I’m a criminal type. It’s 
that I got mixed up by my mother, and I had Oedipus complex.” Then the 
press says, “Well, then, it’s not the children who're at fault; we’ve got to take 
care of the parents,” and the parents say, “We really can’t help it that we’re 
neurotic, it was our parents got us mixed up.” It goes right back to the story in 
the Garden of Eden: when Adam was asked by the Lord God “Didst thou eat 
the fruit of the tree whereof I told thee thou shouldst not eat?” Adam replied, 
“This woman, that thou gavest to me, she tempted me, and I did eat.” And 
when he said to Eve, “Didst thou eat, etc., she said, “The serpent beguiled 
me...” and the Lord God looked at the serpent and the serpent said noth- 
ing. He didn’t pass the buck. He knew the answer because the serpent and 
the Lord God had agreed, long before all this happened, behind the scenes 
before anything started, that they were going to play out this drama because 
the serpent is the left hand of God and “let not your right hand know what 
your left hand doeth.” So you see, that’s the game, the game of hide-and-seek. 


238 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


I don’t see any possibility of, what I would call, a basically healthy attitude to 
life in which you blame other people for what happens. As it would be said in 
Buddhism, everything that happens to you is your karma; that means your own 
doing. It may sound a little megalomaniac, as if to say, well I’m responsible 
for all this, like I’m God. That’s megalomania only if you use the monarchical 
image of God, which is why we cannot say in the West, “I am God.” They 
then put you in the nut-house because you're saying, “I’m the boss, and you 
owe me divine honors.” 

But if we have another image of God, an organic image, similar to the 
human body, who’s in charge? The head? The stomach? The heart? You could 
make an argument for each of them. You could say that the stomach is funda- 
mental, it was there first. It is the organ that distributes vitality through food 
to all other organs. Therefore the stomach is primary. You can argue that the 
head, a ganglion of nerves on the top end of the alimentary canal, is an adjunct 
of the stomach and was evolved in order to scrounge around more intelligently 
to get some stuff to feed the stomach. Then the head stands up and argues, 
“No, I came later, and of course, the stomach was there first, but John the 
Baptist came before Jesus Christ, and I as the head am latest and most evolved 
product, and the stomach is my servant. The stomach is scrounging around to 
give me energy so that I can indulge in philosophy, culture, and religion and 
art.” Both arguments are equally valid or equally invalid. The point about an 
organism is that it’s a cooperation, that is, as Lao-Tzu says, “To be or not to 
be arise mutually. Long and short subtend each other; difficult and easy imply 
each other.” So do subject and object, I and thou. Inside and outside. They all 
come into being together. So do heart and head, head and stomach. They are 
mutual and there is a cooperation in which the order does not derive from 
imposition from above, from an orderer. So Lao-Tzu speaks of the Tao, the 
course and order of nature, saying, “The great Tao extends everywhere, both 
to the left and to the right. It loves and nourishes all things but does not lord 
it over them, and when merits are accomplished, it lays no claim to them.” 
Likewise, “In governing a great state, do it as you cook a small fish,” for when 
you cook a small fish, don’t fuss with it; be very gentle. Don’t overdo it. 

So we can look forward, perhaps, to a day when the President of the 
United States may be someone as anonymous as chief sanitary engineer of 
New York City, who is a very valuable individual performing a most useful 
function. But when the chief sanitary engineer of New York City goes out in 
the streets, there is no fanfare, there are no huge escorts of police, for who 
could care about the sanitary engineer? Even in the Christian tradition there is 
an odd hint of this. In his Epistle to the Philippians, St. Paul says: “Let this mind 
be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, did 
not think equality with God a thing to be clung to, but made himself of no 
reputation and was found in fashion as a man and became obedient to death, 
even to the death of the cross.” The self-emptying or renunciation of power 


WESTERN MYTHOLOGY 239 


by the godhead is called in Greek kenosis, selfemptying. The idea that God 
creates the world by giving up power, by instituting a constitutional monarchy 
instead of a tyrannical one. 

For everybody who has really understood power and the power game, like 
certain great sages and yogis in Asia who have practiced all sorts of psychic 
powers, realizes that psychic powers are not the answer. All manuals of yoga 
and Buddhistic practice will tell you that the siddhi or supernormal powers 
ought to be abandoned because power is not the answer. That’s not what you 
want. See, we get back to the question of thinking through what you want. 
If you get absolute power and you are in perfect control of everything that 
happens, which would be the final ideal of technology, you realize what would 
happen? You have a completely predictable future, you’re the perfect prophet, 
you know everything that’s going to happen, and the moment you know every- 
thing that’s going to happen, you've had it. Because the perfectly known future 
is a past. When in the course of playing games, it becomes quite certain what 
the outcome of the game will be, we always, of course don’t we, abandon the 
game and begin a new one because what we want is a surprise. And as one 
very wise man whom I knew once said to me, “Gnosis, the perfect wisdom or 
enlightenment, is to be surprised at everything.” 


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 


The Future of Religion (1970) 


ne of the major roots of tension and paranoia in the United 
States today is the conflict between religion and politics. It has 
a fascinating history, which is largely a religious history. Most citizens of the 
United States who claim to be religious are either Christians or Jews, inheriting 
a form of religion that is based on a monarchical model of the universe. But 
the nation itself is a republic, ideally and theoretically democratic, having philo- 
sophical origins in an outburst of mysticism that occurred in Western Europe 
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, associated with such individuals as 
Meister Eckhart, John of Ruysbroek, Angelus Silesius, and Richard Tauler, and 
with such movements as the Anabaptists, the Brothers of the Free Spirit, the 
Levellers, and the Quakers, which arose in the three centuries following as a 
consequence of this mystical outburst." 
Mysticism implies democracy because it is the discovery of what George 
Fox called the Inward Light in the hearts of all men, of God not only above 
but also within, thus challenging the authority of the state and the divine right 
of kings with the authority of the individual conscience. It realizes and imple- 
ments the views that all men are equal in the sight of God, or rather, at the 
level of their inmost divinity. From such insights and stirrings as these, as well 
as from economic pressures, hundreds and then thousands left the feudal and 
monarchical order of Europe, came to this country, and eventually established 
a republic as their form of government.

242 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


THE HINDU CONCEPTION OF GOD 


How can one believe that a republic is the best form of government if, at the 
same time, one believes that the universe is a monarchy? For, obviously, if the 
universe is a monarchy with God himself in charge, then monarchical principles 
are the best for ruling. Jews, Catholics, and Fundamentalist Protestants believe 
emphatically that God is the heavenly king and father who must above all be 
obeyed. However, is it possible to be religious, to have faith in God, without 
believing that the universe is a monarchy? Does the idea of God necessarily 
imply the principle of monarchy at the base of the universe? Surely not, for 
there are, outside the Western world, many traditional and, for want of a better 
word, religious views of the universe wherein God—or whatever name may 
be used for the ultimate reality—is not conceived as a monarch. This would 
generally be true for the Hindu, and most definitely for the Buddhist and 
Taoist. The Hindu does not see God as ruling the universe as a king imposes 
order by force on inferior subjects. He sees God, not as ruling, but as acting 
the world as a drama in which he is the player of all the parts, so that the 
whole multiplicity of individual beings are not his subjects but his roles and 
masks (personae). Usually, the actor himself is so absorbed in each part that he 
forgets he is merely playing, but, in certain individual instances, he wakes up 
and says, “Well, at last I have discovered that I am God in disguise.” In Hindu 
culture this discovery is considered, not as madness or megalomania, but as a 
matter for congratulation, since it is not as if the finite individual had suddenly 
claimed to be everybody’s boss. 


THE HEBREW-CHRISTIAN MORALITY 


But if we, in the context of the Hebrew-Christian culture, wake up and discover 
that we are God, we are accused of subversive blasphemy or total insanity, since 
it is understood that one is claiming to be the universal monarch. At the present 
time this is giving us considerable trouble, especially in the industrial-electronic, 
democratic-republican style of culture that has been emerging in the modern 
world. For we are being brought up under the sway of two mutually inconsis- 
tent philosophies. On the one hand, we are told that we must be responsible, 
and that it’s up to us, as independent citizens in equality with all others, to 
assume responsibility for the government of our country. On the other hand, 
instead of doing just that, we are also looking over our shoulders for support 
and authority from tradition, law, and monarchical order deriving from the 
father and the past. Thus when people do something we don’t like, our first, 
naive reaction is to say, “There ought to be a law against it!” 

To give a specific illustration, one of our major social problems today, 
particularly for young people, is our mistrust and dislike of the police. They 
have a terrible public image because we are asking them to do what we 


THE FUTURE OF RELIGION 243 


should be doing for ourselves. We have saddled ourselves with an army of 
armed clergymen charged with compelling us to be moral, with results that 
are dangerously confusing to both the citizen and the policeman. Let us not 
forget that the police officer does not necessarily enjoy this role. For the del- 
egation of such authority to officials of the state is both a hoax on oneself 
and a source of corruption in the state. Moral behavior is significantly and 
truly moral only when it is voluntary. Morality by compulsion reduces us to 
a state that is less than human. It results in a perpetual infantilism in which 
we ask a governmental daddy to force us to behave as we think we ought to 
behave but do not want to behave, and toward whom we must therefore have 
ever-growing resentment. 

It is almost a platitude to say that a free society cannot exist without mutual 
trust and without individual assumption of moral responsibility. To ask the 
government to be responsible for law and order is to ask for a police state. In 
a free society the function of the police is primarily to give information (for 
example, as to the conditions and flow of automotive traffic) and assistance 
(for example, in the event of such disasters as fires and earthquakes). By and 
large, and in the long run, it becomes more and more apparent that threats of 
punishment, and the actual penalties of fine or imprisonment or even death, do 
not significantly promote civilized and rational behavior. On the contrary, they 
may in fact foster crime as an expression of resentment, and it is well-known 
that the Mafia-type syndicates that are involved in gambling and prostitution 
do not want laws against such activities to be repealed. Repeal would lower 
the price and open up the market. Thus, in lobbying for the maintenance of 
sumptuary laws against moral crimes without unwilling victims, the criminal 
syndicates work hand-in-hand with the churches. Never was there more con- 
vincing evidence of the implicit identity of prudery and vice, of righteous, 
boss-type God and malicious Devil. As Lao-Tzu put it: 


The more laws and regulations are given, 
The more robbers and thieves abound. 


All this implies, therefore, that a mature religion (or religiousness) must 
abandon the monarchical image of God. And this is the God of whom many 
theologians are now saying, “God is dead!” But, as we have seen, if there is 
to be any image of conception of God at all, this is not the only option. The 
Bible has, of course, passed down to our present cultures a mythomorphic 
image (or idol) of God modeled on the tyrant-kings of the ancient Near- 
East—the Pharaohs of Egypt, the great Chaldean lawgiver Hammurabi, and 
the Cyruses (Kyrioi) of Persia, in whose likeness God is still venerated when 
we sing “Kyrie eleison—Lord have mercy,” and whose titles “Kind of kings and 
Lord of lords” are still used in the Church of England’s prayer for the King’s 
(or Queen’s) Majesty: 


244 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


O Lord our Heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord of 
lords, the only ruler of princes, who dost from thy throne behold all 
the dwellers upon earth: most heartily we beseech thee with thy favor 
to behold our sovereign Lady Elizabeth the Queen... 


This is obviously the language of court flattery, and the very design of the 
church in which such words are heard is the royal court, or basilica, where the 
king sits enthroned upon a dais with his back to the wall, flanked by a semicircle 
of ministers and guards, and approached by subjects who prostrate themselves 
or kneel, so as to be in a disadvantageous position for starting a fight. 

Yet today a curious transition is taking place in, of all places, the Roman 
Catholic Church. (Always keep your eye on the Catholic Church: it is a spiritual 
weathervane. It’s the most conservative institution in the Western world, and 
thus anything changing there is change at a very deep level.) All over the world, 
Roman Catholic churches are shifting their high altars from the East end to the 
center of their temples, so that the God-Christ no longer sits with his back to the 
wall but comes forward to be the center of the congregation—since “the kingdom 
of heaven is within you.” There is, perhaps, no official realization and, certainly, 
no open statement of what this change implies, for fundamental transformations 
begin at an unconscious level. But by this gesture the Church is turning itself into 
a flower, a mandala, instead of a militarized court, and this intimates—along the 
directions of Teilhard de Chardin’s theology—a radical alteration in the Church’s 
ideas of man’s relation to God, as of the very nature of God. 

What we are beginning to see is a new realization—influenced, no doubt, 
by oriental philosophy—of the relation of the individual to the basic energy 
of the universe that Tillich called “the Ground of Being”’—in an attempt to 
find some name for “the Which than which there is no whicher” bereft of all 
the gloomy and pompous associations that stick to the word “God.” For this 
relationship is no longer to be conceived as that between king and subject, 
commander and soldier, paterfamilias and filially pious child. It is, instead, the 
stelliform relationship of star to its rays, center to circumference, hub to spokes, 
or even role to actor. If God remains in any sense king, the universe is then 
his crown—not something lying abjectly at his feet. 


NEW CONCEPTS OF RELIGION 


Concurrently, religion as a way of life ceases to put its emphasis on doctrine 
(teaching), law (commandments), and obedience, and religious “services” become 
instead celebrations from which words and preachments increasingly disappear. 
Actually, the very word “religion” means bondage, or submission to a rule of 
life. Used in its most exact sense, “religion” is the way of life of a monk or 
nun undertaking the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience—the latter 
virtue ranking (in practice if not theory) higher than divine charity. Catholics 


THE FUTURE OF RELIGION 245 


will, for example, reprove Protestants for interpreting the Bible according to 
their personal opinions and not to the authority of the Church, forgetting, how- 
ever, that the notion of the Church’s authority is their own personal opinion. 
Likewise, supposedly “liberated” people of our own times who put themselves 
under the authority of a guru fail to see that they themselves confer authority 
on the guru by choosing him. 

The monarchical conception of the universe, implying religion as a way 
of obedience, perpetuates forms of ritual, worship, and liturgy with a domi- 
nant emotion of groveling guiltiness and intensely earnest obsequiousness. 
Absolutely no laughter is allowed. The Romans had a saying that when priests 
laugh before the altar, the religion is dead. But how, then, could Dante’s vision 
of hell, purgatory, and paradise be entitled the Divine Comedy? How could he 
have described the singing of the angels as the “laughter of the universe?” The 
underlying supposition of monarchical religion as that you as an individual are 
something quite other than God. You are merely a creature, evoked out of total 
nothingness by a fiat, or whimsy, of the divine will. Contrary to the republican 
axiom that every man has certain inalienable rights; you have no right to exist 
whatsoever: you exist solely by the will and at the pleasure of your sovereign 
Lord, and between you and your divine Author there is an absolute metaphysical 
and ontological gulf. The very core of your being is not the Ground of Being 
itself. You exist on probation. 

Yet as a result of the philosophical thought and the scientific investigations 
of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, this conception of the 
order of the universe has become implausible. We simply do not believe in it, 
although there are many who feel most strongly that they ought to believe, 
which is why there are so many sermons in the churches on the need for a 
revived faith. When it is necessary to have billboards proclaiming the “The 
family which prays together stays together,” we realize that both the family 
and prayer are obsolete. 

In fact we believe that the universe is a mindless mechanism; that mankind 
is a biological fluke on a minute and utterly unimportant planet. That is to say, 
we still view ourselves as subjects and minions—but without a king; as slaves 
with no other master than the laws of nature—and there is no lawmaker. This 
is the image of the universe as a completely computerized bureaucracy with a 
high percentage of inefficiency. In such circumstances, man’s only recourse is 
to fight nature and beat it into submission, realizing at the same time that his 
victories are only temporary, and that his role is essentially tragic since 


all which it inherit shall dissolve, 

And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, 
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff 
As dreams are made on; and our little life 
Is rounded with a sleep. 


246 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


We have developed this mechanistic view of the world because we began, his- 
torically, with the model of the universe as an artifact made by God. Perhaps 
it is not insignificant that Jesus was the son of a carpenter. 

Looking at things this way, we can preen ourselves as realistic, tough-minded 
men who face the hard and brutal facts without illusions or wishful thinking. 
The more lifeless, mindless, and dead our concept of cosmic energy, the more 
the individual can come on with the role of tragic hero. We put ourselves 
down, as biological flukes, in order to put ourselves up as hard-fact-facers taking 
pride in the skill and intensity of our hostility toward our environment. The 
natural outcome of this attitude is a technology that exploits, erodes, pollutes, 
and destroys our physical surroundings. 

But any biologist can demonstrate that man and his physical environment 
constitute an inseparable field or pattern of energy. (That this, unless he is the 
cantankerous, “what-a-realist-I-am” kind of fellow who insists, for example, 
that birds hate flying.) It is nothing more than a conceptual myth, a hallucina- 
tion, that the human organism with its ego-ghost-chauffeur (Koestler’s Ghost in 
the Machine) is other than or apart from the total process of nature, and that 
human intelligence functions separately from the marvelously integrated orga- 
nization of plants, insects, bacteria, animals, gases, and geological formations 
that constellate its environment. Thus the current commonsensical attitude to 
nature that sees man as the ruler and conqueror of the world is, in fact, an 
emotional hangover of the former view of the universe as a mindless chaos 
put into order by the monarchical power of God the Father, which, as we have 
seen, has ceased to be plausible. 


SPECULATIONS ON “RELIGION” OF THE FUTURE 


What, then, is the coming direction of intelligent religious thought and practice? 
Let me begin with a slightly facetious fantasy. Within 20 years, Asia will be laced 
with super-highways, littered with hot-dog stands, billboards, and neon-signs, 
and every coolie will be sporting a business-suit. On the other hand, our own 
highways will be sprouting grass, and there will be an abundance of stately 
lamaseries and ashrams. People will be strolling about in easy robes, fingering 
rosaries and twirling prayer-wheels. There will be enormous schools of philo- 
sophical and theological inquiry, as also of meditation-practice celebrated for 
the superb chanting of Sanskrit and Chinese sutras, and frustrated Tibetans 
will be coming to Chicago to study Buddhism. 

The point is that the direction of our spiritual endeavors will be away from 
interminable verbiage and laying-down of laws. Hitherto, all our churches have 
been talking, preaching, and praying places—reverberating with words upon 
words upon words. The new religious values will be in the domain of experi- 
ence as distinct from ideation and formulation. As Alfred North Whitehead 
said back in 1926: 


THE FUTURE OF RELIGION 247 


When you understand all about the sun and all about the atmosphere 
and all about the rotation of the earth, you may still miss the radiance 
of the sunset. There is no substitute for the direct perception of the 
concrete achievement of a thing in actuality. We want concrete fact 
with a highlight thrown on what is relevant to its preciousness. . . . We 
are too exclusively bookish in our scholastic routine. . . . In the Gar- 
den of Eden Adam saw the animals before he named them; in the 
traditional system [of education], children named the animals before 
they saw them. (Whitehead, 1926/1933, pp. 247-248) 


We have confused knowledge with what can be expressed in words or 
numbers as against what can be felt and sensed. Thus Western religions have 
stressed the overwhelming importance of dogma and belief, that is, of correct 
ideas even beyond the importance of correct behavior. Salvation comes through 
faith rather than works, and, in this context, faith has meant not so much trust 
in life as assent to certain theological propositions. Contrariwise, such oriental 
“religions” as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism—in stressing the importance 
of immediate experience rather than intellectual concepts—are, oddly enough, 
more down-to-earth and (in the best sense) materialistic and empirical than even 
Western science. For what a man senses and feels in his very bones underlies 
how he thinks and behaves. The scientists know, theoretically, that organism 
and environment, man and nature, are all of a piece. But few of them feel it. 
Their theoretical view is not vividly experienced at the level expressed by such 
terms as “cosmic consciousness,” satori, or samadhi. For these are states of 
consciousness as total and overwhelming as falling in love; they are not opin- 
ions or beliefs, wishes or hopes. They are the direct, immediate, and concrete 
experience of the individual’s identity with the entire energy of the universe, 
of himself as an expression of the Ground of Being, set and centered in time- 
less, ultimate reality. 

My position is not that of an anti-intellectual for, after all, my profession is 
the manipulation of words and the pursuit of scholarship in the field of com- 
parative philosophy and religion. However, the intellectual life must, to have 
any substance, be based upon nonverbal and nonconceptual experience. If I talk 
all the time, I cannot hear what others have to say. Similarly, if I think (or talk 
to my self) all the time I have nothing to think about except thoughts. I know 
the map but not the territory; I have read the menu but not tasted the dinner. 

We need to reach this level of experiencing in the sphere of religion, 
and the current fascination for the empirical religions of Asia, for encounter 
groups, sensitivity training, and for sundry experiments in the transforma- 
tion of consciousness by both chemical and psychological methods shows the 
direction in which younger people are moving. If I may, again, be just slightly 
frivolous, I am predicting that we have in circulation a new, but actually very 
ancient religion called OM—a sound that Hindus and Buddhists have used to 


248 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


designate the total energy of the universe because it comprises the whole range 
of sound from the bottom of the throat to the lips, sometimes spelled Aum. 
This religion has neither members nor nonmembers, no hierarchy, no offices, 
no buildings, no organization, and, above all, no doctrines. It is strictly “do-it- 
yourself” religion, consisting entirely of meditation, music, and ritual—but not 
according to any prescribed formulas. To understand it, you must participate 
in it; there are no explanations. 

In meditation, music, and ritual gesture we become free from the hypnotic 
tyranny of words and concepts and return to reality. I will not define reality. 
It cannot be defined, and yet all of you know what it is. It cannot be called 
material or physical, spiritual or mental, for all these are verbalizations and 
concepts. Reality is what the Hindus call nirvikalpa or “nonconceptual,” and it 
is apprehended in meditation because meditation (dhyana) is the silencing of the 
chatter of thoughts in the mind—an art that is assisted by the nonverbal adjuncts 
of music and ritual (mantra and mudra). It brings us into a state of awareness 
in which the notions of self and other, past and future, knower and known, 
mind and body, feeler and feeling, thinker and thought have simply disappeared. 

Most civilized peoples have lost this awareness. We all had it as babies—in 
what Freud called the “oceanic” feeling in which the individual and the sur- 
rounding world were not distinguished. But the oceanic feeling of a baby is 
as different from mature samadhi as an acorn from an oak tree. The baby has 
not yet developed a rich intellectual, emotional, and kinesthetic life, and thus 
has not mastered the technique whereby his oceanic feeling can be expressed 
or realized. However, in the process of education and civilization, most people 
lose this original sense of existence and learn to identify themselves with the 
isolated personality John or Mary by confusion of the symbol with the event. 
To regain it, we must temporarily suspend the symbolizing process in medita- 
tion, even though in meditation itself we have no goal or purpose because we 
are then living completely in the present. Meditation, as generally practiced in 
Asia, is not a self-improvement exercise done with an eye to the future; it is 
being centered in the eternal now, and can be maintained not only while sit- 
ting in the lotus-posture but also in going about one’s ordinary affairs. To use 
Frederic Spiegelberg’s phrase, one might say that real meditation is “the religion 
of no-religion,” since “religion” ordinarily means symbolic action and such 
verbalization as prayer and the study of scriptures. But when Zen monks chant 
the sutras, they concentrate on the sound and pay no attention to the meaning. 

If the human race is to continue in operation, such a new direction in 
religion is essential. It is absolutely urgent that we do not allow our preoccu- 
pation with symbols to distract our awareness from the real world. For what 
on earth is the value of money or status when water is poisonous, air foul, 
food tasteless, and habitation ugly? It is useless to plan for the future when you 
cannot live in the present, for you will never be able to enjoy the fulfillment of 
your plans. Furthermore, all our major quarrels and wars are concerned with 


THE FUTURE OF RELIGION 249 


such symbolic abstractions as ideologies, creeds, states, nations, races, monetary 
investments, contracts, and laws. I am not saying that all such abstractions should 
be abolished forthwith, but—on the principle that the Sabbath is made for man 
and not man for the Sabbath—they should be seen as strictly subordinate and 
instrumental to life itself, having only the same degree or reality as inches or 
lines of longitude. One has but to compare a political map or globe with a 
physical map (or with the new and glorious photograph of the earth from the 
moon) to realize that the former is ugly, unnatural, and absurd. 

In sum, then, I am suggesting that in times to come the focus and center 
of religion must not be on a conceptual God. We must realize that the confu- 
sion of God with theological images is a far more dangerous idolatry than 
the ritual veneration of crucifixes and buddhas, which no sensible person ever 
believed to be the actual deity. The word “God,” if it is to be retained at all, 
must simply designate reality—the dimension of inconceivable, unutterable, and 
ineffable energy in which we not only “live and move and have our being,” but 
that is also the only presence that corresponds to the words “I am.” This as 
experience—not belief—is the only thing that can take us beyond the banality 
of life considered merely as a trip from the maternity ward to the crematorium. 


NOTES 


1. You will see these connections clearly by reading Gooch and Laski (1967). 

2. It is of interest that the younger generation in Japan use the word kurai (“dark,” 
“dank,” “gloomy’”), in relation to certain forms of Buddhism, even though no conception 
of a monarchical God is involved. Nevertheless, it is used with reference to Buddhist 
sects that overstress the patriarchal authority of the priesthood and have strict adher- 
ence to traditional proprieties.

CHAPTER NINETEEN 


Unity in Contemplation (1974) 


bes is, of course, the same as the Latin jungo, and the English 
yoke, meaning “union”—or “integration,” if we want to get a little 
bit fancier. There are many kinds of yoga, suited to different types of people, 
but there are three principal types: Jnan Yoga, the way of knowledge; Karma 
Yoga, the way of action; and Bhakti Yoga, the way of devotion. I imagine that 
the majority of people in this gathering are Bhaktis. In your contemplation, 
the method is centrally adoration of the Godhead as manifested in Jesus Christ, 
and this is Bhakti. I happen temperamentally to be a Jani, and so some of the 
things that I say may seem rather coldly intellectual and lacking the passion 
that you would normally expect from a discourse on contemplative meditation. 
However, even if you go along this Jani way, it is still possible to join in with 
the Bhakti devotions perfectly easily and with considerable enthusiasm, as I have 
during this week in this extraordinary and miraculous assembly. 

Let us begin with the Bhakti way because it is fundamental for most of us 
here. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God”—not just going through the motions, 
but “with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” This 
is the first and great Commandment. How can anybody possibly obey it? In the 
Epistle to the Romans, chapter seven, St. Paul explains that God gave the law 
through Moses, not in the expectation that it would be obeyed, but in order 
that man, in attempting to obey it, would find out that he couldn’t, and would 
therefore be, in Paul’s language, convicted of sin. Now what is sin? Amartanein

in Greek, which is the word we translate or mistranslate as “sin,” means to miss 
the point. To be on the point is what we call yoga or dhyana—concentration— 
centeredness. And a bishop in Greek is an episcopos, which not only means an 
overseer, but the man on the spot. The man who gets the point. Similarly, the 
way of Christ is to be on the mark, not to miss the point. 

Well, you will say, what is the point? How can we get it? We're too big! To 
enter Heaven you have to go through a pearly gate, and you know that’s not a 
gate all studded with pearls. A gate of heaven is one pearl. There are twelve of 
them, because the writer of the Apocalypse designed Heaven according to the 
Zodiac. So there are twelve gates representing twelve different kinds of people 
according to the signs of the Zodiac, or the twelve tribes of Israel, or the twelve 
Apostles. The entrance to into the pearl is the tiny little hole through which the 
string goes. The string is the self-thread that joins the pearls of all our different 
incarnations, but is not any one of them. To go through into Heaven you have 
to be not-you, because, as Jesus said, “Whither I go you cannot come.” You 
have to leave yourself behind, therefore, in order to get in. How can it possibly 
be done? How can one give oneself up, and by one’s own power completely 
abandon oneself to the love of God? That’s the puzzle. That’s what has to be 
tried. All the disciplines that we undertake, all the devotions that we make, all 
the meditative exercises that we do are efforts to give ourselves up. Well, you 
know what it’s like. It’s like having molasses in one hand and feathers in the 
other, and you clap them together and then try to pick off the feathers. And 
the more you do it, the more you're involved; you're stuck. 

When you realize this, you ask yourself a question: “Why do I want to 
love God? Do I really love God? What do I mean by loving God? I’ve never seen 
God. I’ve never seen Jesus. I’ve read about him in the Bible, but I don’t really 
know what kind of a person he was.” Then you get one of those manuals of 
devotion, little black books with pink edges, and you kneel down before the 
Blessed Sacrament and you say, “Jesus, I love you; Jesus, I give my heart to you; 
Jesus, I adore you.” You try, and you say all this and you know you’re a complete 
phony—if you’re honest! Why you're saying this is because you think that’s what 
you ought to do and you want to be on the side of the big battalions. If God 
the Father is the boss of the universe, you'd better get with it and get close to 
Jesus his Son. Otherwise, you might be going to hell. 

If the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, perfect love casts out 
fear, but how are we going to get perfect love? Nobody can ever give the answer. 
I remember Bernard Phillips, who’s a great Zen student, going to a Jesuit Father 
and saying, “Sure, I'll be a Christian, but I want to be a real Christian. I don’t 
want just to say I’m a Christian. Tell me how I’m going to be a Christian with 
absolute devotion and no holds barred.” Well, everybody flunks out. When 
I was a little boy, I was told, “You must do your work.” And I said, “Sure, 
be most happy. Love to have books around me, I love the smell of books, I 
love everything to do with books.” But it was all wrong. They said, “You're 
not working.” They couldn’t explain. I even copied the teachers’ handwriting, 


UNITY IN CONTEMPLATION 253 


so that I could reflect their personalities somehow, and I became an expert 
forger! 

In the same way, you can become a spiritual forger. You can have all the 
outward forms of great spirituality. That’s why I use them, so that you know 
I’m phony! And they’re fun, anyway. But how are we to love God? Well, this 
puzzled St. Paul. He said, “The law brought about sin in me. I had not known 
lust except the Law had said, “Thou shalt not covet.’” Then he says, “Shall we 
sin that grace may abound? Oh, heaven forbid!” But the point was, he said, 
that you are told to come up to a certain standard of selfless behavior, like the 
Sun of Justice itself, to make you see that you can’t. St. Augustine and Mar- 
tin Luther saw the same thing, that the reason they were trying to love God 
was that they were incurably selfish. And what do you do about that? There’s 
a Chinese saying that when the wrong man uses the right means, the right 
means work in the wrong way. Preaching religion, telling people they ought to 
behave this way, that they should have faith, that they should love one another, 
generates nothing but hypocrisy, unless we get to the depths of hypocrisy and 
realize we are hopeless hypocrites. Then we start asking, “What am I to do? 
When I come to the end of my tether, I can’t do anything about it.” 

It’s the same if you follow another way. Say your idea is not that you should 
love God or love Jesus Christ, but that you should let go. Well, that certainly 
applies to Jesus, too. “Be not anxious for the morrow, consider the flowers of 
the field, how they grow. . . .” I’ve never heard a sermon preached on that text, 
incidentally—it’s completely subversive. It’s all very well for Jesus to follow such a 
way because he was the boss’s son and it was no problem to him, but we practi- 
cal people are responsible, and have to do what is known as keeping the world 
going, earning livings, and things like that. We say, “We can’t be not anxious for 
the morrow.” That’s one of the troubles about Christianity: Jesus was the boss’s 
son and therefore had a unique advantage over all the rest of us. So you can't 
follow his example. That’s one of the most important things to understand: that 
you cannot follow the example of Christ. That is the only really good reason for 
believing that Jesus was the unique incarnation of the Son of God. But this means 
Christianity becomes an impossible religion, which cannot be practiced by us. 

Now what does all this mean? It sounds awfully hopeless. I can’t let go of 
myself because I have a selfish reason for wanting to let go of myself. It would 
make me feel better, make me feel more protected against suffering. I'd be like 
a cat; you know, absolutely, that all is God, and there’s nothing to be afraid of 
whatsoever? You'd have no attachments or hang-ups, and you'd be full of delight 
and joy. Wouldn’t you like that? But when we look into ourselves we find a 
sensitive, quaking mess. And there’s nothing you can do about it. But this not 
being able to do anything is a concealed positive. When, for example, God is 
called infinite, without bounds, this could seem very wishy-washy. Something 
without bounds isn’t there; it would be like meeting an infinitely tall person! But 
we do not say God is infinite in order to say that God has no effective power. 
This negative word is affirmative. It’s the same in Hinduism, when it says of 


254 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


the Brahman neti, neti: Brahman is not this, not that, not anything that one 
can conceive. This is an affirmation. In the same way, when you find there’s 
absolutely nothing you can do to improve yourself spiritually, to be more lov- 
ing of God, to be less defensive of self, that there’s nothing you can do, there’s 
a message there, a very important message. 

The reason you can’t do anything is that the “you” you think you are doesn’t 
exist. What we call the ego has a particular existence. It exists in the same way 
as the Equator, or a line of longitude, or an inch. It is a social institution, or a 
convention, but it is not an effective agent, an effective energy, and that’s why 
you can't do anything about it. Let’s analyze this ego, therefore, and see what 
it is. First of all, it arises from a fundamental human confusion between the 
world of real events and the world as described. The first step is language, and 
it is typical of all civilized and even many uncivilized peoples that they confuse 
words with realities, just as we confuse wealth with money, and status with 
happiness. We are the kind of people who would rather eat the menu than 
the dinner. You see it going on all the time, and the whole of advertising is 
based on this confusion, so that the wealthiest among us are not rich. They 
dress like morticians and drive around in hearses; they don’t enjoy themselves 
at all like we’ve been enjoying ourselves. We’ve had an absolute uproar here 
for a week, and we got away with it because we let the world outside know 
that we were doing something very specially holy. Of course, we know how 
to enjoy ourselves; and I’m sure that’s “as being poor but making many rich, 
as having nothing but possessing all things.” But the wealthy of this world, 
the rich in money, are mostly miserable people. People think, “If only I could 
get some more money. I've got all these mortgages and bills and dependents. I 
just want a little more money and then everything would be fine.” So you get 
it. And then you start worrying about whether you're going to get sick; you 
can worry about that endlessly. Or about whether the tax collector is going 
to take it away from you, or whether there’s going to be a revolution. There’s 
always something to worry about if you’re the kind of person who’s inclined 
to worry. We confuse the world as it is with the world as described. That’s 
not a put-down on words, or symbols, or the intellect, but only to say that 
you cannot use words and the intellect properly unless you know that nothing 
is what you say it is. 


For the word is not the thing, 
The word is not the thing, 
Hi ho the derry-o, 

The word is not the thing. 


And, incidentally, there are no things either, but we'll go into that later. 
But you definitely can’t get wet in the noise-water, nor will that noise quench 
your thirst. The confusion of ourselves with our ego is the result of confusing 
reality with a concept. 


UNITY IN CONTEMPLATION 255 


The reality of ourselves is our organism, but the organism is inseparable 
from a particular environment—of other people, plants, animals, air, etcetera, 
forever. And if you fully felt your organism, if you experienced it thoroughly, 
you would know it was inseparable from the entire universe—that the entire 
universe is simply your extended body. But the concept of the ego does not 
include the organism. We say, “I have a body”; we don’t say, “I am a body.” 
Now, what information is there in your ego-concept about how you circulate 
your blood? How you work your nervous system? How you secrete important 
fluids from your glands? After all, you do all that, but your concept of yourself 
contains no information whatsoever about how it’s done. How do you make a 
decision? You say, “I open my hand.” How do you do it? Well, a physiologist 
might explain something about it to you, but he can’t open his hand any better 
than you can. Because when you do it, you know how to do it and, in a sense, 
you just do it—out it comes. But how? You can’t explain, because your self-image 
does not contain that information. So your image of yourself is given to you 
by your parents, your teachers, your relatives, and your peer-group. But don’t 
blame them, because you bought it. They tell you who you are. 

I remember when I was a little boy I admired another boy who lived up the 
street, and I sometimes came home and imitated his mannerisms. My mother 
would look at me in a severe way and say, “Alan, that’s not you, that’s Peter.” 
She was concerned to give me an identity. And when I did something terrible, 
she said, “It’s not like you to do a thing like that.” So, everybody wants you 
to know who you are. There are a number of personalities you can choose 
from—there are certain personality types, like psychological types. You can be 
an introverted intuitive, an extroverted feeling type, and so on. Everybody has 
to have one. Is you is or is you ain’t? Are you a Christian or a Jew, Catholic 
or Protestant, Republican or Democrat, male or female? (That’s a very tricky 
one—there are twelve sexes not just two.)' Everybody’s got to be in a com- 
partment of some kind. And we identify ourselves with an image. It’s called 
a personality, the word persona meaning mask, that through which the sound 
comes, the megaphonic mask of Greek or Roman drama. It’s an act, and we 
are increasingly convinced that we are that persona. But the persona is nothing 
more than a caricature, suggesting something with a few lines and leaving the 
rest out. All that tremendous complex of human relationships and relationships 
with nature that we really are is completely ignored. 

We say, “I still have a feeling of I which is more than my image. I have a 
feeling of great reality, a me, a particular me. What do you suppose that is?” 
Well, it took me a long time, but I found out. When you're a child, they put 
you under a basic double-bind: you are required to do things that will be accept- 
able only if you do them voluntarily. So a mother says at night when a baby 
is restless, “Darling, try to go to sleep.” “You mustn’t be constipated. You have 
to have a bowel movement every day after breakfast.” “As a good child, you 
ought to love your mother, not because I say so but because you really want 
to.” Imagine what happens later in life, when you get married and you get up 


256 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


in front of an altar because you're itchy, and say—you’ll swear anything to get 
hold of that girl—that you will love that woman till death do you part! Of all 
things! That is the greatest expression of disrespect for God the Almighty because 
eventually, as you know, you won't have these excited feelings. It becomes, after 
all, everyday. Some people have luck in this respect and sometimes it doesn’t 
happen, but most people get bored. And then she says, “Darling, do you really 
love me?” What answer does she want? “I am trying my best to do so?” That’s 
not what was wanted at all. If the beloved would say, “I love you so much I’m 
your helpless slave,” that would be more like what was wanted. 

I sat next to a boy in school who had great difficulty in reading. He wanted 
to show that he really was trying. He made noises, he made a special effort 
so the teacher wouldn't get angry and have him beaten. We learn early that 
concentration is something you do with the muscles in your forehead. What 
do you do when somebody says to you, “Now take a hard look at this, care- 
fully”? You will immediately find that in ordinary conditioning there is tension 
around the eyes. “Now listen. Be very attentive to this!” You will find muscles 
straining around the ears. “This needs grit. You’ve got to go through with this. 
It’s a painful situation. Tighten your jaws or clench your fists.” Or, “Control 
yourself,” and you go tight in the solar plexus or in the rectum. All these muscle 
strains become chronic habits and they’re all perfectly futile because they don’t 
have any effect on the efficiency of the nervous system. They get in the way 
of it. If you look at something, such as a clock in the distance, and you can’t 
read the time, you start staring. But it will just become blurred. If you want 
to see a clock in the distance, you should close your eyes and imagine that 
you're looking at a black velvet curtain on a pitch-black night, then open your 
eyes and let the light shine through. Then you might by chance see the clock. 

In all operations of the nervous system we use the intelligence. The reason 
why neurologists don’t fully understand the nervous system is that it’s more 
intelligent than they are. Therefore, what we call our ego is not only the image 
of ourselves; it’s also a chronic sensation of muscular strain, which in some 
people is centered in the solar plexus and in others in the region of the heart. 
In Japanese it’s called kokoro. And you feel that chronic strain there, and that is 
“I.” The true individual (I’m not saying that the individual is unreal) is a total 
organism in relation to its environment. That’s why the half-baked science (it 
is at least half-baked) of astrology draws a picture of the soul by drawing a 
picture of the universe as centered on the particular individual organism. Of 
course, it’s a very crude picture of the universe. Many things aren't there, 
and I don’t think most astrologers know how to read the map, but the idea is 
fundamentally sound. 

Now we come to the point where we have discovered that what we call 
ourselves is a mere symbol, plus vain strainings. So what are you going to do 
about that? Here’s the beginning of the religious life, where “man’s extremity 
is God’s opportunity.” But what can you do? There you are, stuck with this 


UNITY IN CONTEMPLATION 257 


illusion, and when you say, “What can I do about it?” you’re asking what the 
illusion can do to get rid of itself: It is absolutely important to see that noth- 
ing, nothing, nothing can be done about it. So then what? Go out and shoot 
yourself? Well, it does occur to you that, somehow or other, something is going 
on. You're still breathing. Or are you breathing? Or does it breathe you? The 
vibration that we call existence is still there. What is it? 

You may get frightened at this point and begin to ask, “Who's in charge 
around here? If I’m not in control, if nobody’s in control, how will I know that 
I can speak the English language five minutes from now?” Here I am giving 
you a talk, and I don’t know how this talk is happening. I might lose my nerve 
at any moment, but somehow it talks and I don’t really think ahead what I’m 
going to say. But it goes on. So I might begin to wonder, “Am I simply the 
puppet of some god or universal process other than myself?” But where’s the 
puppet? I can’t find this puppet. Then am I God? Am I in charge of everything? 
That’s a frightful responsibility—I’m terrified of it. There was once a young 
man in Los Angeles who got LSD in the wrong way and thought that he was 
God, and was terrified. He turned himself into the police with a note saying, 
“Please help me.” Signed: Jehovah. But supposing both things are true? Or 
both untrue? That there is no puppet being pushed around and there is no 
boss pushing things around. Supposing there is simply a happening, what the 
Chinese call Tzu-jan, their word for nature, which means “what is so of itself.” 
In Thomistic theology it is called aseity, to be so of itself. Aseity is one of the 
attributes of God you don’t hear much about. So there is God—the great Hap- 
pening, what is, in other words, on the mark, or “where it’s at.” 

You realize that you cannot understand the world through concepts. The 
word is not the thing, so you become silent. There’s nothing you can do, so 
you watch. But there’s nobody watching! The idea that there has to be an 
experiencer of experience is merely a concept. What you call the experiencer is 
just one of your thoughts. It’s rather that the happening, the universe is aware 
of itself though your eyes. You’re an aperture through which the universe is 
aware of itself, and you realize nobody ever was in charge. Things have gone 
along reasonably well, most of the time. (I can prove from Hindu cosmology 
that seven parts of life in ten are good, three are bad, but we won't go into that 
now.) But it muddles through reasonably well, and so you watch and you hear 
yourself thinking to yourself. All this chatter going on inside your skull. You 
try to stop it, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do. You want peace, you 
want silence, you want to stop thinking about what you must do tomorrow, 
what you did wrong yesterday, and all that stuff. You say, “Couldn't we have 
peace for a while?” but you're trying to get peace because you want to escape 
reality. Eventually you see that you just can’t help thinking. It goes on like the 
birds outside or the noise of the air-conditioning. So you treat your thinking 
as just that. Just nonsense and hubbub going on inside your head. “You have 
to pay the rent, you have to pay the rent.” Eventually you see the futility of 


258 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


all that, and your mind of itself becomes still. Left alone, it clears itself of the 
mud, the waves cease, and you get clarity. Clarity is very important. This is 
the meaning of “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” Pure in 
heart doesn’t mean that you don’t tell dirty jokes: it means clear like crystal. 
“Purity” or “clarity” suggests two things to us. First, it’s complete emptiness—the 
sky, with no clouds. But “clarity” also means absolutely articulate form: you've 
made it clear. That’s why in Buddhism it is said that the form is the same as 
the void, and the void is the same as the form. 

When you realize that you’re not your ego, you unaccountably disappear, 
and become what is absolutely obvious to you from the beginning. What does 
your head look like from your eyes? Do I experience my head as a black spot in 
the middle of everything, or a fuzzy place? No—it just isn’t there. I’m completely 
headless. All of you have heads; I apparently don’t. Nevertheless, out of this 
absolutely blank spot, I see. In the same way the stars shine out of space. We 
think space isn’t there, it’s nothing, it’s not important—until you stop to realize 
that you can’t have stars without space. How could you have a universe without 
space? How could there be a solid without space? The truth of the matter is 
that every something comes out of nothing. Listen with your ears—concentrate 
with that sense as we were listening yesterday morning to all the small sounds 
in and around the chapel. You hear sounds coming now out of silence. They 
arise spontaneously out of silence, because in this moment you are witnessing 
the creation of the universe. When you stop thinking (Yoga is the cessation 
of vritti in the mind or chitta) with concepts, you suddenly find that there is 
no past and no future. There is an eternal now, but you don’t know what that 
means, because now has meaning only in relation to then. When there is no 
then, there’s no now. So you really don’t know what to say about it. It says 
in one of the Zen texts that you’re like a dumb man who’s had a marvelous 
dream. Everybody wants to tell everybody else about a marvelous dream, but 
when he opens his mouth he can’t say anything. If I try to tell you what this 
state is, all I do is weave a pattern of words, which I’m clever at, because the 
art of the poet and the philosopher is to say what cannot be said—to describe 
the indescribable, to eff the ineffable, and unscrew the inscrutable. But so long 
as one talks, he never gets there. 

That is why I want to emphasize the value of the contemplative life, of 
that silence of the mind. But the moment I say it’s valuable, that you ought 
to pursue it, I’ve said the wrong thing. There is no other reason for it than 
doing it. There is no external or ulterior reason whatsoever to participate in 
that superessential joy that is called God. It’s not your duty, it won’t be good 
for you. If you think, “I’m doing this for a reason, because it will be good for 
me,” you won't see that meditation is the one thing in which you are com- 
pletely here and now. There’s no reason for it; there’s nothing in mind as a 
consequence. You must treat all that chatter (“I’m meditating, I ought to be 
doing this or that”) as gobbledygook. See? That’s all it is. Then you're centered 


UNITY IN CONTEMPLATION 259 


in the only place there is; you’re on the mark; you’re not sinning. I feel this 
has to be said as a corrective to the excessive verbosity of our religiousness. 
Contemplation means what we do together in the temple. And when we gather 
in the temple, it is primarily for silence of the mind. It doesn’t mean we can’t 
have chickens and babies and cats and all sorts of comings and goings, such 
as happen in any temple in India, because you cannot meditate at all unless 
you can do it in a boiler factory, since all sound is the manifestation of the 
energy of the universe. Just listen to it as you would listen to classical music. 
When you listen to the New York Philharmonic playing Beethoven, you don't 
ask what it means, because music means music. Music is a symphona spectacale, 
an end in itself, and therefore to be likened to the Divine Wisdom as a game, 
because games are to be played not for anything beyond them, but for their 
own sake. In the Book of Proverbs, Wisdom speaks and says that her delight is to 
play in the sight of the Almighty, playing among the sons of men. The Divine 
Wisdom, incidentally, is a lady—Sophia, and she’s the other aspect of Logos. 
Then you make the fundamental discovery that life is not serious—it may be 
sincere, but not serous. Wouldn’t it be awful if God were serious? I always love 
to quote G. K. Chesterton saying that angels fly because they take themselves 
lightly. And if they, how much more the Lord of the angels? There would be 
no reason whatsoever for God to take himself seriously. God doesn’t preach, 
God woos. He speaks in the language of the Song of Songs, the language that 
convinces. That’s not the language of “throwing the Book,” though people love 
being scolded, especially in church. 

Mental silence does not involve the absence of physical sound. That’s 
why music, chanting and all sorts of sublimely nonsensical activities are sup- 
ports for contemplation. But remember, in our mantra service, I made the 
distinction between nonsense and claptrap. Nonsense is something of a very 
high order—that which is transcendent of what is sensible. So we make holy 
nonsense and joyful noise to the Lord as we have been doing in our marvelous 
devotions these past days. I think we have all discovered here that in the total 
silence of contemplation and the sublime “non-sense” of mantric prayer we 
have arrived at a tacit and firm understanding, which cannot and should not be 
formulated or defined. Speaking for myself, I have found unity of heart with 
people whose formal religious concepts are very different from mine. This is 
not sentimental friendship. We have met at a level of the spirit in which there 
is nothing to argue about, whether we be Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, 
Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, or Hindus. This is, in Christian terms, the Grace of 
God. It is happening and will go on happening, and it is in this grass-roots, 
spontaneous and unofficial way that a truly catholic and ecumenical religion is 
coming into being—a unity that appreciates and fosters our wonderfully differ- 
ent disciplines of meditation and forms of worship. One morning the “official” 
world will wake up to find that this unity is a fact—in the light of which our 
ancient disputations have become irrelevant. But it will be so, not through our 


260 COMPARATIVE RELIGION 


mutual subscription to vague platitudes such as the Golden Rule, but through 
exploring together the silent depths of mystical experience and practice. A Zen 
Buddhist verse puts it, laughingly, this way: 


When two masters meet on the road, 
They need no introduction. 
Thieves recognize one another instantly. 


In conclusion, I want to offer my thanks to the monks of St. Benedict of 
this community, and to say that this place is an island of sanity in a mad world. 
I am not a monk; | like women too much. But those of you who are so called 
do the most unbelievable service in establishing these islands of constant prayer, 
scholarship and manual work. It’s a very balanced Rule, and you Benedictines, 
being the most ancient Order in the Church, are like true aristocrats. You don’t 
have to blow your own trumpet. Please keep this going! Do not lose courage. 
It is such a great service to the rest of us. Naturally there are members here 
of many other Orders, but I speak particularly to our hosts. It is essential that 
there be people in the world who are sitting on the mountain peaks, because 
if there isn’t someone around who is contemplating God, the life of the rest of 
us is absurd. Someone must be there to give the rest of us, as it were, a center.

CHAPTER TWENTY 


The Individual as Man/World (1963) 


YB eases note: The following was originally delivered as an 
impromptu lecture for the Social Relations Colloquium at 
Harvard University on April 12, 1963. Although the subject was not discussed 
in the lecture itself, its theme is closely related to the expansion of conscious- 
ness achieved through psychedelic substances. With proper “set and setting,” 
the psychedelics are very frequently successful in giving the individual a vivid 
sensation of the mutual interdependence of his own behavior and the behavior 
of his environment, so that the two seem to become one—the behavior of a 
unified field. Those who uphold the impoverished sense of reality sanctioned by 
official psychiatry describe this type of awareness as “depersonalization,” “loss 
of ego-boundary,” or “regression to the oceanic feeling,” all of which, in their 
usual contexts, are derogatory terms suggesting that the state is hallucinatory. 
Yet it accords astonishingly well with the description of the individual that is 
given in the behavioral sciences, in biology and in ecology. 

Theoretically, many scientists know that the individual is not a skin- 
encapsulated ego but an organism-environment field. The organism itself is 
a point at which the field is “focused,” so that each individual is a unique 
expression of the behavior of the whole field, which is ultimately the universe 
itself. But to know this theoretically is not to feel it to be so. It was possible to 
calculate that the world was round before making the voyage that proved it 
to be so. The psychedelics are, perhaps, the ship, the experimental instrument 
by which the theory can be verified in common experience.)

264 PSYCHEDELICS 


There is a colossal disparity between the way in which most individuals 
experience their own existence, and the way in which the individual is described 
in such sciences as biology, ecology, and physiology. The nub of the difference 
is this: the way the individual is described in these sciences is not as a freely 
moving entity within an environment, but as a process of behavior that is the 
environment also. If you will accurately describe what any individual organism 
is doing, you will take but a few steps before you are also describing what the 
environment is doing. To put it more simply, we can do without such expres- 
sions as “what the individual is doing” or “what the environment is doing,” as if 
the individual was one thing and the doing another, the environment one thing 
and its doing another. If we reduce the whole business simply to the process of 
doing, then the doing, which was called the behavior of the individual, is found 
to be at the same time the doing that was called the behavior of the environ- 
ment. In other words, it is quite impossible to describe the movement of my 
arm except in relation to the rest of my body and to the background against 
which you perceive it. The relations in which you perceive this movement are 
the absolutely necessary condition for your perceiving at all. More and more, 
a “field theory” of man’s behavior becomes necessary for the sciences. 

Yet this is at complete variance with the way in which we are trained by 
our culture to experience our own existence. We do not, generally speaking, 
experience ourselves as the behavior of the field, but rather as a center of 
energy and consciousness, which sometimes manages to control its environ- 
ment, but at other times feels completely dominated by the environment. Thus 
there is a somewhat hostile relationship between the human organism and its 
social and natural environment, which is expressed in such phrases as “man’s 
conquest of nature,” or “man’s conquest of space,” and other such antagonistic 
figures of speech. 

It would obviously be to the advantage of mankind if the way in which 
we feel our existence could correspond to the way in which existence is scien- 
tifically described. For what we feel has far more influence upon our actions 
than what we think. Scientists of all kinds are warning us most urgently that 
we are using our technology disastrously, eating up all the natural resources of 
the earth, creating incredibly beautiful but wholly nonnutritious vegetables by 
altering the biochemical balances of the soil, spawning unbelievable amounts 
of detergent froth, which will eventually engulf cities, overpopulating ourselves 
because of the success of medicine, and thus winning our war against nature in 
such a way as to defeat ourselves completely. All this advice falls on deaf ears, 
because it falls on the ears of organisms convinced that war against nature is 
their proper way of life. They have to be unconvinced, and can be, to some 
extent, by intellectual propaganda, scientific description, and clear thought. But 
this moves relatively few people to action. Most are moved only if their feelings 
are profoundly affected. We need to feel this view of our individual identity as 
including its environment, and this must obviously concern scientists who are 
trying to find ways of controlling human feelings. 


THE INDIVIDUAL AS MAN/WORLD 265 


This problem has an important historical background. It is curious how 
the ancient philosophical debates of the Western world keep coming up again 
and again in new forms. Any question of the definition of the individual always 
becomes involved with the old argument between nominalism and realism. I do 
not wish to insult the intelligence of this learned audience, but, just to refresh 
your memories, the realistic philosophy of the Middle Ages and of the Greeks 
was not what today we call realism. It was the belief that behind all specific 
manifestations of life such as men, trees, dogs, there lies an archetypal, or ideal, 
form of Man, of Tree, of Dog, so that every particular man is an instance of 
that archetypal form, and that behind all men is something that can be called 
Man with a capital M, or the “substance” of man, of “human nature.” 

The nominalists argued that this was a mere abstraction, and that to regard 
Man (capital M) as possessing any effective existence was to be deluded by con- 
cepts. There are only specific, individual men. This idea is carried on in one of 
the most remarkable forms of modern nominalism, General Semantics, which 


29 6 


argues that such abstractions as “The United States,” “Britain,” or “Russia,” are 
so much journalistic gobbledygook. 

Most people working in the sciences tend to be nominalists. But if you carry 
nominalism to its logical conclusion, you are involved in awkward problems. Not 
only would there be no such thing as Man, Mankind, or Human Nature, but it 
would also follow that there are no individual men, because the individual man 
is an abstraction, and what really exists is only an enormous amalgamation of 
particular molecules. If you pursue this further and inquire about the individual 
entities composing the molecules, there is an interminable array of nuclear and 
subnuclear realities, and if these in turn are to be regarded as the only realities, 
then the reality that we call a man is simply the association of discontinuous 
particles. This is the reductio ad absurdum of nominalism carried too far. The 
nominalist and realist viewpoints are actually limits—to borrow a term from 
mathematics. I have often thought that all philosophical debates are ultimately 
between the partisans of structure and the partisans of “goo.” The academic 
world puts heavy emphasis on structure: “Let’s be definite, let’s have rigor and 
precision, even though we are studying poetry.” But the poets will reply: “We 
are for goo, and you people are all dry bones, rattling in the wind. What you 
need is essential juices, and therefore more goo is necessary to liven you up.” 
But when we want to know what goo is, and examine it carefully, we eventually 
turn up with a structure, the molecular or atomic composition of goo! On the 
other hand, when we try to examine the structure itself to study the substance 
of its bones, we inevitably come up with something gooey. When the micro- 
scope focus is clear, you have structure. But when you reach beyond the focus 
and what confronts you is vague and amorphous, you have goo because you 
cannot attain clarity. Structure and goo are essentially limits of human thought; 
similarly, the nominalist-structural and the realist-gooey will always be essential 
limits in our thinking. We must be aware that today, the particular academic 
and scientific fashion leans heavily in the direction of structure and nominalism. 


266 PSYCHEDELICS 


To take a specific example, we all know that in modern medicine nominal- 
ism and structuralism hold the field. When you go to a hospital, you are liable 
to go through a process of examination by specialists working upon you from 
different points of view. They will treat you as a nonperson, from the very 
moment you enter. You are immediately put in a wheelchair—a symbol of the 
fact that you are now an object. You will be looked at piecemeal, X-rays will 
be taken of various organs, and special tests will be made of their functioning. 
If anything is wrong, you will be taken to a medical mechanic, i.e., a surgeon, 
who will use his equivalents of wrenches, screwdrivers and blowtorches to make 
certain mechanical alterations in your organism, and it is hoped you will get 
along fairly well with these repairs! 

But the opposite, minority school of medicine will say: “This is all very 
well, and the services of the surgeon are sometimes greatly welcomed, but man 
must be considered as a whole. He has complicated metabolic and endocrine 
balances, and if you interfere with him seriously at one point, you will affect 
him unpredictably at many others, for man is an organic whole.” Such are 
accused of being woolly-minded, old-fashioned doctors, mostly from Europe, 
with a kind of nature-cure background, who will use diet, complicated fasts, 
and massage. The poor layman doesn’t know whether to deliver himself over 
to these old-fashioned naturalistic doctors or to Mr. Sawbones with his very 
up-to-date qualifications. 

Fortunately, precise science is coming to the rescue of our man-as-whole. 
More recent studies are showing just how diseases formerly regarded as spe- 
cific entities, or afflictions of a particular organ or area, are actually brought 
about by responses of the central nervous system, acting as an integrated 
whole. We are beginning to see how man, as a complex of organs, is not an 
addition of parts, like an automobile. His various organs are not to be treated 
as if they were assembled together, but by seeing the physical body as a uni- 
fied or integrated pattern of behavior—which is just what we mean when we 
talk about an entity or thing. What happens when we have the feeling that 
we understand something, when we say, “Oh, I see”? If a child asks, “Why 
are the leaves green?” and you answer, “Because of the chlorophyll,” and the 
child says, “Oh!” that is pseudo-understanding. But when the child has a jigsaw 
puzzle and sees how it all fits together, then the “Oh!” has a different meaning 
from the “Oh!” following the chlorophyll explanation. To understand anything 
is to be able to fit various parts into a system that is an integrated whole, so 
that they “make sense.” 

As organic diseases are fitted into a whole, and problems of crime or 
psychosis in individual behavior are fitted in with a pattern of social behavior 
that makes sense, that is consistent with those kinds of behaviors, we say 
“Aha!—now I see!” 

Fascinating work is being done in studying the ways in which the individual 
as a system of behavior is related to his biological and social environments, 


THE INDIVIDUAL AS MAN/WORLD 267 


showing how his behavior may be explained in terms of those environments. 
One of the people who has done very important work in this sphere is our 
distinguished colleague, B. F. Skinner. I cite his work because it brings out these 
ideas in a marvelously clear, crucial, and provocative way, and because it is evi- 
dence for conclusions that he himself does not seem to have realized. One of 
his most important statements is in his book, Science and Human Behavior (1953): 


The hypothesis that man is not free is essential to the application of 
scientific method to the study of human behavior. The free inner 
man who is held responsible for the behavior of the external biologi- 
cal organism is only a prescientific substitute for the kinds of causes 
which are discovered in the course of a scientific analysis. (p. 447) 


He is talking, of course, about the chauffer inside the body, or what 
Wittgenstein called the little man inside the head: this is for him a prescientific 
substitute for the kinds of causes for behavior that are discovered in the course 
of scientific analysis. He continues: 


All these alternative causes lie outside the individual. The biological 
substratum itself is determined by prior events in a genetic process. 
Other important events are found in the nonsocial environment and in 
the culture of the individual in the broadest possible sense. These are 
the things which make [italics added] the individual behave as he does. 
For them he is not responsible and for them it is useless to praise or 
blame him. It does not matter that the individual may take it upon 
himself to control variables of which his own behavior is a function 
or, in a broader sense, to engage in the design of his own culture. He 
does this only because he is the product of a culture which generates 
[italics added] self-control or cultural design as a mode of behavior. 
The environment determines the individual even when he altars the 
environment. (pp. 447-448) 


I am not going to quarrel with this finding. I am not a clinical or experi- 
mental psychologist and am therefore unqualified to criticize Skinner's evidence. 
Let’s take it for Gospel, simply for the sake of argument. 

But there is a rather heavy emphasis upon the individual being the pup- 
pet. “All these alternative causes,” i.e., the kinds of causes discovered in the 
course of scientific behavior, “lie outside the individual,” i.e., outside this wall 
of flesh and bag of skin. The individual is therefore passive. This is psychol- 
ogy in terms of Newtonian physics. The individual is a billiard ball upon 
which other balls impinge, and his seemingly active behavior is only a passive 
response. Skinner admits the individual does and can alter the environment, 
but when he does so, he is being made to do so. This is put forth in such a 


268 PSYCHEDELICS 


way as to make the individual appear passive and the things really controlling 
his behavior outside him. 

But the reciprocal relationship between the knower and the known, com- 
mon to all the sciences, is set aside here although he mentions it elsewhere 
(Skinner, 1961): 


A laboratory for the study of behavior contains many devices for con- 
trolling the environment and for recording and analyzing the behavior 
of organisms. With the help of these devices and their associated 
techniques, we change the behavior of an organism in various ways, 
with considerable precision. But note that the organism changes our 
behavior in quite as precise a fashion. Our apparatus was designed 
by the organism we study, for it was the organism which led us to 
choose a particular manipulandum, particular categories of stimulation, 
particular modes of reinforcement, and so on, and to record particular 
aspects of its behavior. Measures which were successful were for that 
reason reinforcing and have been retained, while others have been, as 
we say, extinguished. The verbal behavior with which we analyze our 
data has been shaped in a similar way: order and consistency emerged 
to reinforce certain practices which were adopted, while other practices 
suffered extinction and were abandoned. (All scientific techniques, as 
well as scientific knowledge itself, are generated in this way. A cyclotron 
is “designed” by the particles it is to control, and a theory is written by 
the particles it is to explain, as the behavior of these particles shapes 
the nonverbal and verbal behavior of the scientist.) (p. 543) 


In one of his essays, he has a cartoon of a mouse saying to another, “Boy have I 
got that guy up there fixed! Every time I press this bar, he gives me some food!” 

Although Skinner seems in general to be stressing heavily the point of 
view that the individual is the puppet in the field in which he is involved, he is 
nevertheless stating here the opposite point, that the individual organism, mouse, 
or guinea pig, in the experiment is nevertheless determining the environment 
even when, as in a laboratory, the environment is designed to control the spe- 
cific organism. The environment of a rat running in a barn is not designed to 
control the rat, but the more it is so designed, the more the rat is involved in 
and shaping its environment. He writes elsewhere that what he has been saying 


does not mean that anyone in possession of the methods and results 
of science can step outside the stream of history and take evolution of 
government into his own hands. Science is not free, either. It cannot 
interfere with the course of events; it is simply part of that course. It 
would be quite inconsistent if we were to exempt the scientist from 


THE INDIVIDUAL AS MAN/WORLD 269 


the account which science gives of human behavior in general. (Skin- 
ner, 1953, p. 446) 


Now we might well object: “Look, Professor Skinner, you say we are 
completely conditioned behavior-systems. We cannot change anything. At the 
same time, you are calling upon us to embark upon the most radical program 
of controlling human behavior. How can you write Walden II, a utopia? Are 
you not a monstrosity of inconsistency by calling for responsible human action 
and at the same time saying that we have no freedom?” But is this actually 
a contradiction? He is saying two things, both of which can be valid, but he 
does not provide a framework in which the opposed points of view can make 
sense. Similarly, the physicist says light can be considered as a wave or as a 
particle system. These sound mutually exclusive to the nonphysicist. In the 
same way, the advocacy of a planned development of human resources and 
potentials, coupled with the idea that the individual is not a self-controlling, 
skin-encapsulated ego, needs some further concept to help it along. The fol- 
lowing passage clinches the problem: 


Just as biographers and critics look for external influences to account 
for the traits and achievements of the men they study, so science ulti- 
mately explains behavior in terms of “causes” or conditions which lie 
beyond the individual himself. As more and more causal relations are 
demonstrated, a practical corollary becomes difficult to resist: it should 
be possible to produce behavior according to plan simply by arranging 
the proper conditions. (Skinner, 1955-1956, p. 47) 


There is the contradiction that necessarily arises in a psychology with a 
language system that incorporates into present scientific knowledge an out- 
moded conception of the individual—the individual as something bounded by 
skin, and that is pushed around by an environment that is not the individual. 
Skinner (1953) is naturally aware that his emphasis on our passive relationship 
to conditioning causes is rather unpalatable: 


The conception of the individual which emerges from a scientific 
analysis is distasteful to most of those who have been strongly affected 
by democratic philosophies . . . it has always been the unfortunate task 
of science to dispossess cherished beliefs regarding the place of man 
in the universe. It is easy to understand why men so frequently flatter 
themselves—why they characterize the world in ways which reinforce 
them by providing escape from the consequences of criticism or other 
forms of punishment. But although flattery temporarily strengthens 
behavior, it is questionable whether it has any ultimate survival value. 


270 PSYCHEDELICS 


If science does not confirm the assumptions of freedom, initiative, and 
responsibility in the behavior of the individual, these assumptions will 
not ultimately be effective either as motivating devices or as goals in 
the design of culture. We may not give them up easily, and we may, 
in fact, find it difficult to control ourselves or others until alternative 
principles have been developed. (p. 449) 


There the book ends, and there is no suggestion as to what those principles 
might be, even though they are implied in his conclusions: 


When an individual conspicuously manipulates the variables of which 
the behavior of another [italics added] individual is a function, we say 
that the first individual controls the second, but we do not ask who 
or what controls the first. When a government conspicuously controls 
its citizens, we consider this fact without identifying the events that 
control the government. When the individual is strengthened as a 
measure of counter-control, we may, as in democratic philosophies, 
think of him as a starting point. 


Isn't this political nominalism? 


Actually, however, we are not justified in assigning to anyone or anything 
[italics added] the role of prime mover. Although it is necessary that 
science confine itself to selected segments in a continuous series of 
events, it is to the whole series [italics added] that any interpretation 
must eventually apply. (pp. 448-449) 


We are now listening to a man who represents himself as a behavioristi- 
cally oriented, nonmystical, on-the-whole materialistic, hard-headed scientist. 
Yet this passage is the purest mysticism, which might have come straight from 
Mahayana Buddhism: “We are not justified in assigning to anyone or anything 
the role of prime mover.” No segment, no particular pattern of integrated 
behavior within whatever universe we are discussing can be called the prime 
mover. Now this is the Dharmadhatu doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism; that the 
universe is a harmonious system that has no governor, that it is an integrated 
organism but nobody is in charge of it. Its corollary is that everyone and 
everything is the prime mover. 

In Skinner’s language, the popular conception of the inner self, the little 
man inside the head who is controlling everything, must be replaced by the 
whole system of external causes operating upon the individual, the whole net- 
work of causal relationships. But this language obscures a very simple thing: 
when there is a certain cause in the external environment whose effect is always 
a particular individual behavior, you are using very cumbersome language for 


THE INDIVIDUAL AS MAN/WORLD 271 


something you can describe more simply. For when you find these two things 
going together, you are actually talking about one thing. To say that Event A 
causes Event B is a laborious way of saying that it is one Event C. If I lift up 
this book by a corner, all the corners are lifted up at the same time. If I lift 
up an accordion, there is an interval between cause and effect. Similarly when 
we study the individual’s behavior, we are studying a system of relationships, 
but we are looking at it too close up. All we see is the atomic events, and we 
don’t see the integrated system that would make them make sense if we could 
see it. Our scientific methods of description suffer from a defective conception 
of the individual. The individual is not by any means what is contained inside 
a given envelope of skin. The individual organism is the particular and unique 
focal point of a network of relations that is ultimately a “whole series’—I 
suppose that means the whole cosmos. And the whole cosmos so focused is 
one’s actual self. This is, whether you like it or not, pure mysticism. Skinner 
is saying that although science is a method of observation, which, by reason 
of the blinkers of the head, is limited to our one-thing-at-a-time method of 
thought, science can only look at the world area by area. But science also 
becomes the method of understanding its own limitations. When you conduct 
any experiment, you must be careful to exclude variables you cannot measure. 
When you want to keep something at a constant temperature, you must put 
it into some kind of heat-and-cold-proof or shock-proof, or cosmic-ray-proof 
system. So by excluding variables and by having to do it rigorously, you begin 
to understand how really impossible it is to do except in very special cases. In 
this way, the scientist, by attempting to isolate events and by looking as rigor- 
ously as he can at one segment of the world at a time, becomes aware of the 
fact that this looking at things simply in segments, although it is a form of very 
bright, clear, conscious knowledge, is also a form of ignorance. For it is a form 
of “ignore-ance,” ignoring everything that is not in that segment. Therefore he 
becomes aware of the fact that just this is ultimately what you can’t do. You 
can do it only to discover you cannot do it. 

I commend these observations to you simply to show how a scientific 
thinker whose whole stance is in the direction of mechanism, or regarding 
the human being as a kind of biological puppet, must be forced by the logic 
of his own thinking to conclusions of a rather different kind. He states these 
questions in veiled language, so that neither he nor his colleagues will see their 
disastrously unrespectable implications! 

Suppose, then, it becomes possible for us to have a new sense of the indi- 
vidual, that we all become conscious of ourselves as organism-environment 
fields, vividly aware of the fact that when we move, it is not simply my self 
moving inside my skin, exercising energy upon my limbs, but also that in some 
marvelous way the physical continuum in which I move is also moving me. The 
very fact that I am here in this room at all is because you are here. It was a 
common occurrence, a whole concatenation of circumstances that go together, 


272 PSYCHEDELICS 


each reciprocally related to all. Would such an awareness be significant? Would 
it add to our knowledge? Would it change anything, make any difference? Seri- 
ously, I think it would; because it makes an enormous difference whenever what 
had seemed to be partial and disintegrated fits into a larger integrated pattern. 
It will of course be impossible finally to answer the question, “Why does that 
satisfy us?” because to answer this question exhaustively I would have to be able 
to chew my own teeth to pieces. In the pursuit of scientific knowledge, always 
watch out for that snag. You will never get to the irreducible explanation of 
anything because you will never be able to explain why you want to explain, 
and so on. The system will gobble itself up. The Gédel theory has roughly 
to do with the idea that you cannot have any system that will define its own 
axioms. An axiom in one system of logic must be defined in terms of another 
system, etc., etc. You never get to something that is completely self-explanatory. 
That of course is the limit of control, and the reason why all systems of control 
have ultimately to be based on an act of faith. 

The problem confronting all sciences of human behavior is that we have 
the evidence (we are staring at it) to give us an entirely different conception 
of the individual than that which we ordinarily feel and that influences our 
common sense: a conception of the individual not, on the one hand, as an 
ego locked in the skin, nor, on the other hand, as a mere passive part of the 
machine, but as a reciprocal interaction between everything inside the skin and 
everything outside it, neither one being prior to the other, but equals, like the 
front and back of a coin.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 


A Psychedelic Experience 


Fact or Fantasy (1964) 


Ss. at least 1500 B.C. men have, from time to time, held the view 
that our normal vision of the world is a hallucination—a dream, 
a figment of the mind, or, to use the Hindu word that means both art and 
illusion, a maya. The implication is that, if this is so, life need never be taken 
seriously. It is fantasy, a play, a drama to be enjoyed. It does not really matter, 
for one day (perhaps in the moment of death) the illusion will dissolve, and 
each one of us will awaken to discover that he himself is what there is and all 
that there is—the very root and ground of the universe, or the ultimate and 
eternal space in which things and events come and go. 

This is not simply an idea that someone “thought up,” like science fiction 
or a philosophical theory. It is the attempt to express an experience in which 
consciousness itself, the basic sensation of being “I,” undergoes a remarkable 
change. We do not know much about these experiences. They are relatively 
common, and arise in every part of the world. They occur to both children and 
adults. They may last for a few seconds and come once in a lifetime, or they 
may happen repeatedly and constitute a permanent change of consciousness. 
With baffling impartiality they may descend upon those who never heard of 
them, as upon those who have spent years trying to cultivate them by some type 
of discipline. They have been regarded, equally, as a disease of consciousness 
with symptoms everywhere the same, like measles, and as a vision of higher 
reality such as comes in moments of scientific or psychological insight. They 
may turn people into monsters and megalomaniacs, or transform them into

saints and sages. While there is no sure way of inducing these experiences, a 
favorable atmosphere may be created by intense concentration, by fasting, by 
sensory deprivation, by hyper-oxygenation, by prolonged emotional stress, by 
profound relaxation, or by the use of certain drugs. 

Experiences of this kind underlie some of the great world religions—Hindu- 
ism, Buddhism and Taoism in particular, and, to a much lesser extent, Judaism, 
Christianity, and Islam. As expressed in the doctrines of these religions, they 
purport to be an account of “the way things are” and therefore invite com- 
parison with descriptions of the universe and of man given by physicists and 
biologists. They contradict common sense so violently and are accompanied 
with such a powerful sense of authenticity and reality (more real than reality 
is a common description) that men have always wondered whether they are 
divine revelations or insidious delusions. 

This problem becomes all the more urgent now that the general public 
has become aware that experiences of this type are available, with relative ease, 
through the use of such chemicals as the so-called psychedelic drugs—LSD-25, 
mescaline, psilocybin, hashish, and marijuana, to name only the better known. 
The reality status of the modes of consciousness induced by these chemicals 
becomes, then, a matter of most serious concern for the guardians of our 
mental health, for psychiatrists and psychologists, philosophers and ministers, 
for every scientific investigator of the nature of consciousness, and, above all, 
for a large section of the general public curious and eager to get “the experi- 
ence” for reasons of all kinds. 

A proper study of the question runs, at the very beginning, into two 
obstacles. The first is that we know very little indeed about the structure and 
chemistry of the brain. We do not know enough of the ways in which it gleans 
information about the outside world and about itself to know whether these 
chemicals help it (as lenses help the eyes) or confuse it. The second is that the 
nature and use of these chemicals is surrounded with an immense semantic 
fog, whose density is increased by people who ought to know better. I mean 
psychiatrists. 

What we know, positively and scientifically, about psychedelic chemicals 
is that they bring about certain alterations of sense perception, of emotional 
level and tone, of identity feeling, of the interpretation of sense data, and of 
the sensations of time and space. The nature of these alterations depends on 
three variables: the chemical itself (type and dosage), the psycho-physiological 
state of the subject, and the social and aesthetic context of the experiment. 
Their physiological side effects are minimal, though there are conditions (e.g., 
disease of the liver) in which some of them may be harmful. They are not 
physiologically habit-forming in the same way as alcohol and tobacco, though 
some individuals may come to depend upon them for other (i.e., “neurotic”) 
reasons. Their results are not easily predictable since they depend so largely 
upon such imponderables as the setting, and the attitudes and expectations 


A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE 275 


of both the supervisor and the subject. The (enormous) scientific literature 
on the subject indicates that a majority of people have pleasant reactions, a 
largish minority have unpleasant but instructive and helpful reactions, while a 
very small minority have psychotic reactions lasting from hours to months. It 
has never been definitely established that they have led directly to a suicide. (I 
am referring specifically here to LSD-25, mescaline, the mushroom derivative 
psilocybin, and the various forms of cannabis, such as hashish and marijuana.) 

Thus what we know for certain implies that these chemicals cannot be 
used without caution. But this applies equally to antibiotics, whisky, house- 
hold ammonia, the automobile, the kitchen knife, electricity, and matches. No 
worthwhile life can be lived without risks, despite current American superstitions 
to the contrary—as that passing laws can prevent people from being immoral 
and that technological power can be made foolproof. The question is therefore 
whether the risks involved in using these chemicals are worthwhile, and it seems 
to me that what is worthwhile should be judged not only in terms of useful 
knowledge or therapeutic effect, but also in terms of simple pleasure. (I have 
heard addiction to music described in just the same vocabulary as addiction 
to drugs.) If it turns out that psychedelics offer valid ways of exploring man’s 
“inner world,” the hidden ways of the mind and brain, we should surely admit 
that new knowledge of this inmost frontier may be worth quite serious risks. 
Psychoses and compulsive delusions are, after all, no more dangerous than the 
Indians and the mountain ranges that stood in the way of the first settlers of 
the American West. 

Psychiatrists often wonder why colleagues in other branches of medicine 
and specialists in other fields of science do not take them quite seriously. A 
typical reason may be found in their haste to define the nature and effects of 
these chemicals in terms that are simply prejudicial, and that boil down to 
nothing more than gobbledygook with an authoritative rumble. For example, 
the chemicals in question are commonly classified as “hallucinogenics” or “psy- 
chotomimetics.” The first word means that they generate hallucinations, and 
the second that their effects resemble, or mimic, certain forms of psychosis or 
insanity. Only rarely do they give the impression of events in the external world 
that are not actually happening (i.e., hallucinations) and the 10-year-old notion 
that they induce “model psychoses” such as temporary schizophrenia has long 
been abandoned by those who are still in active research. But even if these 
findings were to be contested, the words “hallucination” and “psychosis” are 
loaded: they designate bad states of mind, whereas a clean scientific language 
should say only that these chemicals induce different and unusual states of mind. 

It is almost a standard joke that psychiatry has pejorative or “put-down” 
words for every human emotion, as “euphoric” for happy, “fixated” for 
interested, and “compulsive” for determined. The discussion of psychedelic 
chemicals, both in the scientific literature and the public press, is thoroughly 
swamped with question-begging language of this kind in articles that purport 


276 PSYCHEDELICS 


to be impartial and authoritative. Right from the start the very word “drug,” 
when used in this connection, evokes the socially reprehensible image of people 
who are “drugged” or “doped’”—glassy-eyed, staggering, or recumbent wrecks 
of humanity, withdrawn from reality into a diabolic paradise of bizarre or 
lascivious dreams. The image of the Fu Manchu opium den, with screaming 
meemies at the end of the line. 

Thus it is most common to find the action of psychedelics called “toxic” 
(i.e., poisonous), and the sensory and emotional changes induced referred to 


20 


as “distortions,” “delusive mechanisms,” “dissociations,” and “regressions,” or 
as “loss of ego structure” and “abnormal perception of body image.” This is 
the language of pathology. Used without explicit qualification, it implies that a 
consciousness so changed is sick. Likewise, when—in the context of a scientific 
article—the writer reports, “Subjects experienced religious exaltation, and some 
described sensations of being one with God,” and leaves it at that, the implica- 
tion is plainly that they went crazy. For in our own culture, to feel that you 
are God is insanity almost by definition. But, in Hindu culture, when someone 
says, “I have just found out that I am God,” they say, “Congratulations! You 
at last got the point.” Obviously, the word “God” does not mean the same 
thing in both cultures. Yet psychiatrists toss off such utterly damning remarks 
without scruple, and feel free to use their diagnostic jargon of mental pathol- 
ogy for states of consciousness that many of them have never even bothered 
to experience. For they expect to get accurate information about these states 
from subjects untrained in scientific description, fearing that if they themselves 
entered into any new mode of consciousness it would impair their scientific 
objectivity. This is pure scholasticism, as when the theologians said to Galileo, 
“We will not look through your telescope because we already know how the 
universe is ordered. If your telescope were to show us anything different, it 
would be an instrument of the devil.” 

Similarly, so many practitioners of the inexact sciences (e.g., psychology, 
anthropology, sociology) let it be known most clearly that they already know 
what reality is, and therefore what sanity is. For these poor drudges reality is 
the world of nonpoetry: it is the reduction of the physical universe to the most 
banal and desiccated terms conceivable, in accordance with the great Western 
myth that all nature outside the human skin is a stupid and unfeeling mecha- 
nism. There is a sort of “official psychiatry” of the army, state mental hospital, 
and of what, in California, they call “correctional facility” (i.e., prison), which 
defends this impoverished reality with a strange passion. 

To come, then, to any effective evaluation of these chemicals and the 
changed states of consciousness and perception that they induce, we must 
begin with a highly detailed and accurate description of what they do, both 
from the standpoint of the subject and of the neutral observer, despite the 
fact that in experiments of this kind it becomes startlingly obvious that the 
observer cannot be neutral, and that the posture of “objectivity” is itself one 


A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE 277 


of the determinants of the outcome. As the physicist well knows, to observe a 
process is to change it. But the importance of careful description is that it may 
help us to understand the kind of level of reality upon which these changes in 
consciousness are taking place. 

For undoubtedly they are happening. The dancing, kaleidoscopic arabesques 
that appear before closed eyes are surely an observation of some reality, though 
not, perhaps, in the physical world outside the skin. But are they rearranged 
memories? Structures in the nervous system? Archetypes of the collective uncon- 
scious? Electronic patterns such as often dance on the TV screen? What, too, 
are the fern-like structures that are so often seen—the infinitude of branches 
upon branches upon branches, or analogous shapes? Are these a glimpse of 
some kind of analytical process in the brain, similar to the wiring patterns in a 
computer? We really have no idea, but the more carefully observers can record 
verbal descriptions and visual pictures of these phenomena, the more likely 
that neurologists or physicists or even mathematicians will turn up the physi- 
cal processes to which they correspond. The point is that these visions are not 
mere imagination, as if there had ever been anything mere about imagination! 
The human mind does not just perversely invent utterly useless images out of 
nowhere at all. Every image tells us something about the mind or the brain 
or the organism in which it is found. 

The effects of the psychedelics vary so much from person to person and 
from situation to situation that it is well nigh impossible to say with any exacti- 
tude that they create certain particular and invariable changes of consciousness. 
I would not go so far as to say that the chemical effects are simply featureless, 
providing no more than a vivid mirror to reflect the fantasies and unconscious 
dispositions of the individuals involved. For there are certain types of change 
that are usual enough to be considered characteristic of psychedelics: the sense 
of slowed or arrested time, and the alteration of “ego boundary’—that is, of 
the sensation of one’s own identity. 

The feeling that time has relaxed its pace may, to some extent, be the 
result of having set aside the better part of a day just to observe one’s own 
consciousness, and to watch for interesting changes in one’s perception of such 
ordinary things as reflected sunlight on the floor, the grain in wood, the texture 
of linen, or the sound of voices across the street. My own experience has never 
been of a distortion of these perceptions, as in looking at oneself in a concave 
mirror. It is rather that every perception becomes—to use a metaphor—more 
resonant. The chemical seems to provide consciousness with a sounding box, or 
its equivalent, for all the senses, so that sight, touch, taste, smell, and imagina- 
tion are intensified like the voice of someone singing in the bathtub. 

The change of ego boundary sometimes begins from this very resonance 
of the senses. The intensification and “deepening” of color, sound and texture 
lends them a peculiar transparency. One seems to be aware of them more than 
ever as vibration, electronic and luminous. As this feeling develops it appears 


278 PSYCHEDELICS 


that these vibrations are continuous with one’s own consciousness and that the 
external world is in some odd way inside the mind-brain. It appears, too, with 
overwhelming obviousness, that the inside and the outside do not exclude one 
another and are not actually separate. They go together; they imply one another, 
like front and back, in such a way that they become polarized. As, therefore, 
the poles of a magnet are the extremities of a single body, it appears that the 
inside and the outside, the subject and the object, the self and the world, the 
voluntary and the involuntary, are the poles of a single process that is my real 
and hitherto unknown self. This new self has no location. It is not something 
like a traditional soul, using the body as a temporary house. To ask where it 
is, is like asking where the universe is. Things in space have a where, but the 
thing that space is in doesn’t need to be anywhere. It is simply what there is, 
just plain basic isness! 

How easily, then, an unsophisticated person might exclaim, “I have just 
discovered that I am God!” Yet if, during such an experience, one retains any 
critical faculties at all, it will be clear that anyone else in the same state of 
consciousness will also be God. It will be clear, too, that the “God” in ques- 
tion is not the God of popular theology, the Master Technician who controls, 
creates, and understands everything in the universe. Were it so, a person in this 
state should be able to give correct answers to all questions of fact. He would 
know the exact height of Mount Whitney in millimeters. On the other hand, 
this awareness of a deeper and universal self would correspond exactly with 
that other type of God that mystics have called the “divine ground” of the 
universe, a sort of intelligent and super-conscious space containing the whole 
cosmos as a mirror contains images . . . though the analogy fails in so far as 
it suggests something immense: we cannot picture sizelessness. 

Anyone moving into completely unfamiliar territory may at first misunder- 
stand and misinterpret what he sees, as is so evident from the first impressions 
of visitors to foreign lands where patterns of culture differ radically from their 
own. When Europeans depicted their first impressions of China, they made 
the roofs of houses exaggeratedly curly and people’s eyes slanted at least 45 
degrees from the horizontal. Contrariwise, the Japanese saw all Europeans as 
red-haired, sunken-eyed goblins with immensely long noses. But the unfamil- 
iarities of foreign cultures are nothing to those of one’s own inner workings. 
What is there in the experience of clear blue sky to suggest the structure of 
the optical nerves? Comparably, what is there in the sound of a human voice 
on the radio to suggest the formation of tubes and transistors? I raise this 
question because it is obvious that any chemically induced alteration of the 
nervous system must draw the attention of that system to itself. I am not 
normally aware that the sensation of blue sky is a state of the eyes and brain, 
but if I see wandering spots that are neither birds nor flying saucers, I know 
that these are an abnormality within the optical system itself. In other words, I 


A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE 279 


am enabled, by virtue of this abnormality, to become conscious of one of the 
instruments of consciousness. But this is most unfamiliar territory. 

Ordinarily, we remain quite unaware of the fact that the whole field of 
vision with its vast multiplicity of colors and shapes is a state of affairs inside 
our heads. Only eyes within a nervous system within a whole biological organ- 
ism can translate the particles and/or waves of the physical world into light, 
color and form, just as only the skin of a drum can make a moving hand go 
“Boom!” Psychedelics induce subtle alterations of perception that make the 
nervous system aware of itself, and the individual suddenly and unaccustomedly 
becomes conscious of the external world as a state of its own body. He may 
even go so far as to feel a confusion between what other people and things 
are doing, on the one hand, and his own volition, on the other. The particular 
feeling, or “cue,” attached to thoughts and actions normally understood to be 
voluntary may then be attached to what is ordinarily classified as involuntary. 
(Similarly, in déjd vu or “hasn’t-this-happened-before?” experiences, perceptions 
of the immediate here and now come through with the cue or signal usually 
attached to memories.) 

Under such circumstances the naive observer might well take these impres- 
sions so literally as to feel that the universe and his own body are in fact one 
and the same, that he is willing everything that happens, and that he is indeed 
the God of popular theology. If that were all, the psychedelics might certainly 
be dismissed as hallucinogens. We might conclude that they merely confuse the 
“wiring” of the nervous system in such a way that volition or “I-am-doing-this” 
signals get mixed up with messages about the external world. 

Yet the problem cannot be set aside so simply. Let us suppose that a biolo- 
gist wants to make a very detailed and accurate description of the behavior 
of some particular organism, perhaps of a sea bird feeding on the beach. He 
will be unable to describe the behavior of the bird without also describing the 
behavior of the water, of the sandworms or shellfish that the bird is eating, of 
seasonal changes of tide, temperature, and weather, all of which go together 
with behavior of the bird. He cannot describe the behavior of the organism 
without also describing the behavior of its environment. We used to attribute 
this to the fact that organisms are always reacting to things that happen in 
their environments, and are even determined by their environments in all that 
they do. But this is to speak as if things were a collection of perfectly separate 
billiard balls banging against one another. Today, however, the scientist tends 
more and more to speak of the behavior of the organism and the behavior 
of the environment as the behavior of a single “field,” somewhat awkwardly 
named the “organism/environment.” Instead of talking about actions and reac- 
tions between different things and events, he prefers to speak of transactions. 
In the transaction of buying and selling, there is no selling unless there is 
simultaneous buying, and vice versa. The relation of organism to environment 


280 PSYCHEDELICS 


is also considered a transaction, because it has been found that living creatures 
exist only in a balanced relationship to one another. The present natural state 
of this planet “goes with” the existence of human beings, just as buying goes 
with selling. In any radically different environment, man could survive only by 
becoming a different type of being. 

The implications of this organism/environment relationship are somewhat 
startling, for what is really being said is this: The entity we are describing is 
not an organism in an environment; it is a unified field or process, because it 
is more simple and more convenient to think of what the organism does and 
what the environment does as a single “behavior.” Now substitute for “entity 
we are describing” the idea of the self. I myself am not just what is bounded 
by my skin. I myself (the organism) am what my whole environmental field 
(the universe) is doing. It is, then, simply a convention, a fashion, an arbitrary 
social institution, to confine the self to some center of decision and energy 
located within this bag of skin. This is no more than the rule of a particular 
social game of cops and robbers, that is, of who shall we praise and reward, 
and who shall we blame and punish? To play this game, we pretend that the 
origin of actions is something inside each human skin. But only force of long 
ingrained habit makes it hard to realize that we could define and actually feel 
ourselves to be the total pattern of the cosmos as focused or expressed here. 
This would be a sense of our identity consistent with the scientific description 
of man and other organisms. It would involve, too, the sensation that the exter- 
nal world is continuous with and one with our own bodies—a sensation very 
seriously needed in a civilization where men are destroying their environment 
by misapplied technology. This is the technology of man’s conquest of nature, 
as if the external world were his enemy and not the very matrix in which he is 
brought forth and sustained. This is the technology of the dust bowls, of pol- 
luted air, poisoned streams, chemical chickens, pseudo-vegetables, foam-rubber 
bread, and the total Los Angelization of man. 

Yet how is this long-ingrained sense of insular identity to be overcome? 
How is twentieth-century man to gain a feeling of his existence consistent with 
twentieth-century knowledge? We need very urgently to know that we are not 
strangers and aliens in the physical universe. We are not dropped here by divine 
whim or mechanical fluke out of some other universe altogether. We did not 
arrive, like birds on barren branches; we grew out of this world, like leaves 
and fruit. Our universe “humans” just as a rosebush “flowers.” We are living 
in a world where men all over the planet are linked by an immense network 
of communications, and where science has made us theoretically aware of 
our interdependence with the entire domain of organic and inorganic nature. 
But our ego-feeling, our style of personal identity, is more appropriate to men 
living in fortified castles. 

There seems to me a strong possibility that the psychedelics (as a medicine 
rather than a diet) may help us to “trigger” a new sense of identity, providing the 


A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE 281 


initial boost to get us out of the habit of restricting “I” to a vague center within 
the skin. That they make us aware that our whole knowledge of the external 
world is a state of our own bodies is not a merely technical and trivial discovery. 
It is the obverse of the fact that our own bodies are functions, or behaviors, 
of the whole external world. This—at first—weird and mystical sensation of 
“unity with the cosmos” has been objectively verified. The mystic’s subjective 
experience of his identity with “the All” is the scientist's objective description 
of ecological relationship, of the organism/environment as a unified field. 

Our general failure (over the past 3,000 years of human history) to notice 
the inseparability of things, and to be aware of our own basic unity with the 
external world, is the result of specializing in a particular kind of conscious- 
ness. For we have very largely based culture and civilization on concentrated 
attention, on using the mind as a spotlight rather than a floodlight, and by 
this means analyzing the world into separate bits. Concentrated attention is 
drummed into us in schools; it is essential to the three Rs; it is the foundation 
of all careful thought and detailed description, all high artistic technique and 
intellectual discipline. But the price we pay for this vision of the world in vivid 
detail, bit by bit, is that we lose sight of the relationships and unities between 
the bits. Furthermore, a form of attention that looks at the world bit by bit 
doesn’t have time to examine all possible bits; it has to be programmed (or 
prejudiced) to look only at significant bits, at things and events that are relevant 
to certain preselected ends—survival, social or financial advancement, and other 
fixed goals that exclude the possibility of being open to surprises, and to those 
delights that are extra special because they come without being sought. 

In my own experience, which is shared by very many others, the psyche- 
delics expand attention. They make the spotlight of consciousness a floodlight 
that not only exposes ignored relationships and unities but also brings to light 
unsuspected details—details normally ignored because of their lack of signifi- 
cance, or their irrelevance to some prejudice of what ought to be. (For example, 
the tiniest hairs on people’s faces and blotchy variations of skin color, not really 
supposed to be there, become marvelously visible.) There is thus good reason 
to believe that the psychedelics are the opposite of hallucinogens insofar as 
they decrease the selectivity of the senses and expose consciousness to events 
beyond those that are supposed to deserve notice. 

Time after time, this unprogrammed mode of attention, looking at things 
without looking for things, reveals the unbelievable beauty of the everyday 
world. Under the influence of programmed attention, our vision of the world 
tends to be somewhat dusty and drab. This is for the same reason that staring 
at things makes them blurred, and that trying to get the utmost out of a par- 
ticular pleasure makes it something of a disappointment. Intense beauty and 
intense pleasure are always gratuitous, and are revealed only to senses that are 
not seeking and straining. For our nerves are not muscles; to push them is to 
reduce their efficiency. 


282 PSYCHEDELICS 


What, finally, of the strong impression delivered both by the psychedelics 
and by many forms of mystical experience that the world is in some way an 
illusion? A difficulty here is that the word “illusion” is currently used pejoratively, 
as the negative of everything real, serious, important, valuable, and worthwhile. 
Is this because moralists and metaphysicians are apt to be personality types 
lacking the light touch? Illusion is related etymologically to the Latin ludre, to 
play, and thus is distinguished from reality as the drama is distinguished from 
“real life.” In Hindu philosophy, the world is seen as a drama in which all the 
parts—each person, animal, flower, stone, and star—are roles or masks of the 
one supreme Self, which plays the lila or game of hide and seek with itself 
for ever and ever, dismembering itself as the Many and remembering itself as 
the One through endless cycles of time, in the spirit of a child tossing stones 
into a pond through a long afternoon in summer. The sudden awakening of 
the mystical experience is therefore the one Self remembering itself as the real 
foundation of the seemingly individual and separate organism. 

Thus the Hindu maya, or world illusion, is not necessarily something bad. 
Maya is a complex word signifying the art, skill, dexterity, and cunning of the 
supreme Self in the exercise of its playful, magical, and creative power. The 
power of an actor so superb that he is taken in by his own performance. The 
God-head amazing itself, getting lost in a maze. 

Classical illustrations of maya include the apparently continuous circle of 
fire made by a whirling torch, and of the continuity of time and moving events 
by the whirring succession of ksana, or atomic instants. Physicists use similar 
metaphors in trying to explain how vibrating wavicles produce the illusion of 
solid material. The impenetrability of granite, they say, is something like the 
apparently solid disk made by the blades of an electric fan: it is an intensely rapid 
motion of the same minute orbits of light that constitute our fingers. Physics 
and optics have also much to say about the fact that all reality, all existence is 
a matter of relationship and transaction. Consider the formula 


a b = Rainbow, 


where a is the sun, b is moisture in the atmosphere, and c is an observer, all 
three being at the same time in a certain angular relationship. Deduct any 
one term, a, b, or c, or arrange them in positions outside the correct angular 
relationship, and the phenomenon “rainbow” will not exist. In other words, 
the actual existence of rainbows depends as much upon creatures with eyes 
as it depends upon the sun and moisture in the atmosphere. Common sense 
accepts this in respect to diaphanous things like rainbows that back off into the 
distance when we try to reach them. But it has great difficulty in accepting the 
fact that chunky things like apartment buildings and basic things like time and 


A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE 283 


space exist in just the same way—only in relation to certain structures known 
as organisms with nervous systems. 

Our difficulty in accepting for ourselves so important a part in the actual 
creation or manifestation of the world comes, of course, from this thorough 
habituation to the feeling that we are strangers in the universe—that human 
consciousness is a fluke of nature, that the world is an external object that we 
confront, that its immense size reduces us to a pitiful unimportance, or that 
geological and astronomical structures are somehow more real (hard and solid?) 
than organisms. But these are actually mythological images of the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries—ideas that, for a while, seemed extremely plau- 
sible, mostly for the reason that they appeared to be hardboiled, down to earth 
and tough-minded, a currently fashionable posture for the scientist. Despite 
the lag between advanced scientific ideas and the common sense of even the 
educated public, the mythology of man as a hapless fluke trapped in a mind- 
less mechanism is breaking down. The end of this century may find us, at last, 
thoroughly at home in our own world, swimming in the ocean of relativity as 
joyously as dolphins in the water. 


CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 


Psychedelics and Religious Experience (1968) 


he experiences resulting from the use of psychedelic drugs are 

often described in religious terms. They are therefore of interest 
to those like myself who, in the tradition of William James, are concerned with 
the psychology of religion. For more than thirty years I have been studying the 
causes, consequences, and conditions of those peculiar states of consciousness in 
which the individual discovers himself to be one continuous process with God, 
with the Universe, with the Ground of Being, or whatever name he may use by 
cultural conditioning or personal preference for the ultimate and eternal reality. 
We have no satisfactory and definitive name for experiences of this kind. The 


29 66 


terms “religious experience,” “mystical experience,” and “cosmic consciousness” 
are all too vague and comprehensive to denote that specific mode of conscious- 
ness, which, to those who have known it, is as real and overwhelming as falling 
in love. This article describes such states of consciousness as and when induced 
by psychedelic drugs, although they are virtually indistinguishable from genu- 
ine mystical experience. It then discusses objections to the use of psychedelic 
drugs that arise mainly from the opposition between mystical values and the 
traditional religious and secular values of Western society. 

The idea of mystical experiences resulting from drug use is not readily 
accepted in Western societies. Western culture has, historically, a particular 
fascination with the value and virtue of man as an individual, self-determining, 
responsible ego, controlling himself and his world by the power of conscious 
effort and will. Nothing, then, could be more repugnant to this cultural tradition 
than the notion of spiritual or psychological growth through the use of drugs.

286 PSYCHEDELICS 


A “drugged” person is by definition dimmed in consciousness, fogged in judg- 
ment, and deprived of will. But not all psychotropic (consciousness-changing) 
chemicals are narcotic and soporific, as are alcohol, opiates, and barbiturates. 
The effects of what are now called psychedelic (mind-manifesting) chemicals 
differ from those of alcohol as laughter differs from rage or delight from depres- 
sion. There is really no analogy between being “high” on LSD and “drunk” on 
bourbon. True, no one in either state should drive a car, but neither should 
one drive while reading a book, playing a violin, or making love. Certain cre- 
ative activities and states of mind demand a concentration and devotion that 
are simply incompatible with piloting a death-dealing engine along a highway. 

I myself have experimented with five of the principle psychedelics: LSD- 
25, mescaline, psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and cannabis. I have 
done so, as William James tried nitrous oxide, to see if they could help me in 
identifying what might be called the “essential” or “active” ingredients of the 
mystical experience. For almost all the classical literature on mysticism is vague, 
not only in describing the experience, but also in showing rational connections 
between the experience itself and the various traditional methods recommended 
to induce it—fasting, concentration, breathing exercises, prayers, incantations, 
and dances. A traditional master of Zen or Yoga, when asked why such-and-such 
practices lead or predispose one to the mystical experience, always responds, 
“This is the way my teacher gave it to me. This is the way I found out. If 
you're seriously interested, try it for yourself.” This answer hardly satisfies an 
impertinent, scientific-minded, and intellectually curious Westerner. It reminds 
him of archaic medical prescriptions compounding five salamanders, powdered 
gallows-rope, three boiled bats, a scruple of phosphorous, three pinches of 
henbane, and a dollop of dragon dung dropped when the moon was in Pisces. 
Maybe it worked, but what was the essential ingredient? 

It struck me, therefore, that if any of the psychedelic chemicals would 
in fact predispose my consciousness to the mystical experience, I could use 
them as instruments for studying and describing that experience as one uses a 
microscope for bacteriology, even though the microscope is an “artificial” and 
“unnatural” contrivance that might be said to “distort” the vision of the naked 
eye. However, when I was first invited to test the mystical qualities of LSD-25 
by Dr. Keith Ditman of the Neuropsychiatric Clinic at UCLA Medical School, 
I was unwilling to believe that any mere chemical could induce a genuine 
mystical experience. I thought it might at most bring about a state of spiritual 
insight analogous to swimming with water wings. Indeed, my first experi- 
ment with LSD-25 was not mystical. It was an intensely interesting aesthetic 
and intellectual experience that challenged my powers of analysis and careful 
description to the utmost. 

Some months later, in 1959, I tried LSD-25 again with Drs. Sterling Bun- 
nell and Michael Agron, who were then associated with the Langley-Porter 
Clinic in San Francisco. In the course of two experiments I was amazed and 


PSYCHEDELICS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 287 


somewhat embarrassed to find myself going through states of consciousness 
that corresponded precisely with every description of major mystical experiences 
I had ever read.' Furthermore, they exceeded both in depth and in a peculiar 
quality of unexpectedness the three “natural and spontaneous” experiences of 
this kind that I had had in previous years. 

Through subsequent experimentation with LSD-25 and the other chemicals 
named above (with the exception of DMT, which I find amusing but relatively 
uninteresting) I found I could move with ease into the state of “cosmic con- 
sciousness,” and in due course become less and less dependent on the chemicals 
themselves for “tuning in” to this particular wavelength of experience. Of the 
five psychedelics tried, I found LSD-25 and cannabis suited my purposes best. 
Of these two, the latter, which I had to use abroad in countries where it is 
not outlawed, proved to be the better. It does not induce bizarre alterations of 
sensory perception, and medical studies indicate that it may not, save in great 
excess, have the dangerous side effects of LSD, such as psychotic episodes. 

For the purpose of this study, in describing my experiences with psychedelic 
drugs, I avoid the occasional and incidental bizarre alterations of sense percep- 
tion that psychedelic chemicals may induce. I am concerned, rather, with the 
fundamental alterations of the normal, socially induced consciousness of one’s 
own existence and relation to the external world. I am trying to delineate the 
basic principles of psychedelic awareness. But I must add that I can speak only 
for myself. The quality of these experiences depends considerably upon one’s 
prior orientation and attitude to life, although the now voluminous descriptive 
literature of these experiences accords quite remarkably with my own. 

Almost invariably, my experiments with psychedelics have had four dominant 
characteristics. I shall try to explain them—in the expectation that the reader 
will say, at least of the second and third, “Why, that’s obvious! No one needs 
a drug to see that.” Quite so, but every insight has degrees of intensity. There 
can be obvious, and obvious,—and the latter comes on with shattering clarity, 
manifesting its implications in every sphere and dimension of our existence. 

The first characteristic is a slowing down of time, a concentration in the 
present. One’s normally compulsive concern for the future decreases, and one 
becomes aware of the enormous importance and interest of what is happening 
at the moment. Other people, going about their business on the streets, seem 
to be slightly crazy, failing to realize that the whole point of life is to be fully 
aware of it as it happens. One therefore relaxes, almost luxuriously, in study- 
ing the colors in a glass of water, or in listening to the now highly articulate 
vibration of every note played on an oboe or sung by voice. 

From the pragmatic standpoint of our culture, such an attitude is very bad 
for business. It might lead to improvidence, lack of foresight, diminished sales 
of insurance policies, and abandoned savings accounts. Yet this is just the cor- 
rective that our culture needs. No one is more fatuously impractical than the 
“successful” executive who spends his whole life absorbed in frantic paperwork 


288 PSYCHEDELICS 


with the objective of retiring in comfort at sixty-five, when it will be all too 
late. Only those who have cultivated the art of living completely in the pres- 
ent have any use for making plans for the future, for when the plans mature 
they will be able to enjoy the results. “Tomorrow never comes.” I have never 
yet heard a preacher urging his congregation to practice that section of the 
Sermon on the Mount, which begins, “Be not anxious for the morrow... .” 
The truth is that people who live for the future are, as we say of the insane, 
“not quite all there”’—or here: by overeagerness they are perpetually missing 
the point. Foresight is bought at the price of anxiety, and, when overused, it 
destroys all its own advantages. 

The second characteristic I will call awareness of polarity. This is the vivid 
realization that states, things, and events that we ordinarily call opposite are 
interdependent, like back and front or the poles of a magnet. By polar aware- 
ness one sees that things that are explicitly different are implicitly one: self and 
other, subject and object, left and right, male and female—and then, a little 
more surprisingly, solid and space, figure and background, pulse and interval, 
saints and sinners, and police and criminals, ingroups and outgroups. Each is 
definable only interns of the other, and they go together transactionally, like 
buying and selling, for there is no sale without a purchase, and no purchase 
without a sale. As this awareness becomes increasingly intense, you feel that 
you yourself are polarized with the external universe in such a way that you 
imply each other. Your push is its pull, and its push is your pull—as when you 
move the steering wheel of a car. Are you pushing it or pulling it? 

At first, this is a very odd sensation, not unlike hearing your own voice 
played back to you on an electronic system immediately after you have spoken. 
You become confused, and wait for it to go on! Similarly, you feel that you are 
something being done by the universe, yet that the universe is equally something 
being done by you—which is true, at least in the neurological sense that the 
peculiar structure of our brains translates the sun into light and air vibrations 
into sound. Our normal sensation of relationship to the outside world is that 
sometimes we push it, and sometimes it pushes us. But if the two are actu- 
ally one, where does the action begin and responsibility rest? If the universe 
is doing me, how can I be sure that, two seconds hence, I will still remember 
the English language? If I am doing it, how can I be sure that, two seconds 
hence, my brain will know how to turn the sun into light? From such unfamiliar 
sensations as these the psychedelic experience can generate confusion, paranoia, 
and terror—even though the individual is feeling his relationship to the world 
exactly as it would be described by a biologist, ecologist, or physicist, for he is 
feeling himself as the unified field of organism and environment. 

The third characteristic, arising from the second, is awareness of relativity. 
I see that I am a link in an infinite hierarchy of processes and beings, ranging 
from molecules through bacteria and insects to human beings, and, maybe, to 
angels and gods—a hierarchy in which every level is in effect the same situation. 


PSYCHEDELICS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 289 


For example, the poor man worries about money while the rich man worries 
about his health: the worry is the same, but the difference is in its substance or 
dimension. I realize that fruit flies must think of themselves as people, because, 
like ourselves, they find themselves in the middle of their own world—with 
immeasurably greater things above and smaller things below. To us, they all 
look alike and seem to have no personality—as do the Chinese when we have 
not lived among them. Yet fruit flies must see just as many subtle distinctions 
among themselves as we among ourselves. 

From this it is but a short step to the realization that all forms of life and 
being are simply variations on a single theme: we are all in fact one being doing 
the same thing in as many different ways as possible. As the French proverb 
goes, plus ¢a change, plus c’est la méme chose—“the more it varies, the more it 
is one.” I see, further, that feeling threatened by the inevitability of death is 
really the same experience as feeling alive, and that as all beings are feeling 
this everywhere, they are all just as much “I” as myself. Yet the “I” feeling, to 
be felt at all, must always be a sensation relative to the “other,” to something 
beyond its control and experience. To be at all, it must begin and end. But 
the intellectual jump that mystical and psychedelic experience make here is in 
enabling you to see that all these myriad I-centers are yourself—not, indeed, 
your personal and superficial conscious ego, but what Hindus call the paramat- 
man, the self of all selves.* As the retina enables us to see countless pulses 
of energy as a single light, so the mystical experience shows us innumerable 
individuals as a single Self. 

The fourth characteristic is awareness of eternal energy, often in the form 
of intense white light, which seems to be both the current in your nerves and 
that mysterious e that equals mc’. This may sound like megalomania or delusion 
of grandeur—but one sees quite clearly that all existence is a single energy, 
and that this energy is one’s own being. Of course there is death as well as 
life, because energy is a pulsation, and just as waves must have both crests and 
troughs the experience of existing must go on and off. Basically, therefore, there 
is simply nothing to worry about, because you yourself are the eternal energy 
of the universe playing hide-and-seek (off-and-on) with itself. At root, you are 
the Godhead, for God is all that there is. Quoting Isaiah just a little out of 
context: “I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light and create the 
darkness: I make peace, and create evil. I, the Lord, do all these things.”’ This 
is the sense of the fundamental tenet of Hinduism, Tat tvam asi—“THAT (i.e., 
“that subtle Being of which this whole universe is composed”) art thou.”* A 
classical case of this experience, from the West, is in Tennyson’s (1898) Memoirs: 


A kind of waking trance I have frequently had, quite up from boy- 
hood, when I have been all alone. This has generally come upon me 
thro’ repeating my own name two or three times to myself silently, 
till all at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of 


290 PSYCHEDELICS 


individuality, the individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away 
into boundless being, and this not a confused state, but the clearest 
of the clearest, the surest of the surest, the weirdest of the weirdest, 
utterly beyond words, where death was an almost laughable impos- 
sibility, the loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction 
but the only true life. (p. 320) 


Obviously, these characteristics of the psychedelic experience, as I have 
known it, are aspects of a single state of consciousness—for I have been 
describing the same thing from different angles. The descriptions attempt to 
convey the reality of the experience, but in doing so they also suggest some of 
the inconsistencies between such experience and the current values of society. 

Resistance to allowing use of psychedelic drugs originates in both religious 
and secular values. The difficulty in describing psychedelic experiences in tradi- 
tional religious terms suggests one ground of opposition. The Westerner must 
borrow such words as samadhi or moksha from the Hindus, or satori or kensho 
from the Japanese, to describe the experience of oneness with the universe. We 
have no appropriate word because our own Jewish and Christian theologies will 
not accept the idea that man’s inmost self can be identical with the Godhead, 
even though Christians may insist that this was true in the unique instance 
of Jesus Christ. Jews and Christians think of God in political and monarchical 
terms, as the supreme governor of the universe, the ultimate boss. Obviously, 
it is both socially unacceptable and logically preposterous for a particular indi- 
vidual to claim that he, in person, is the omnipotent and omniscient ruler of 
the world—to be accorded suitable recognition and honor. 

Such an imperial and kingly concept of the ultimate reality, however, is 
neither necessary nor universal. The Hindus and the Chinese have no difficulty 
in conceiving of an identity of the self and the Godhead. For most Asians, 
other than Moslems, the Godhead moves and manifests the world in much 
the same way that a centipede manipulates a hundred legs: spontaneously, 
without deliberation or calculation. In other words, they conceive the universe 
by analogy with an organism as distinct from a mechanism. They do not see 
it as an artifact or construct under the conscious direction of some supreme 
technician, engineer, or architect. 

If, however, in the context of Christian or Jewish tradition an individual 
declares himself to be one with God, he must be dubbed blasphemous (sub- 
versive) or insane. Such a mystical experience is a clear threat to traditional 
religious concepts. The Judaeo-Christian tradition has a monarchical image of 
God, and monarchs, who rule by force, fear nothing more than insubordination. 
The Church has therefore always been highly suspicious of mystics because they 
seem to be insubordinate and to claim equality or, worse, identity with God. 
For this reason John Scotus Erigena and Meister Eckhart were condemned as 
heretics. This was also why the Quakers faced opposition for their doctrine of 


PSYCHEDELICS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 291 


the Inward Light, and for their refusal to remove hats in church and in court. 
A few occasional mystics may be all right so long as they watch their language, 
like Saint Teresa of Avila and Saint John of the Cross, who maintained, shall we 
say, a metaphysical distance of respect between themselves and their heavenly 
King. Nothing, however, could be more alarming to the ecclesiastical hierarchy 
than a popular outbreak of mysticism, for this might well amount to setting 
up a democracy in the kingdom of heaven—and such alarm would be shared 
equally by Catholics, Jews, and fundamentalist Protestants. 

The monarchical image of God with its implicit distaste for religious 
insubordination has a more pervasive impact than many Christians might admit. 
The thrones of kings have walls immediately behind them, and all who pres- 
ent themselves at court must prostrate themselves or kneel because this is an 
awkward position from which to make a sudden attack. It has perhaps never 
occurred to Christians that when they design a church on the model of a royal 
court (basilica) and prescribe church ritual, they are implying that God, like a 
human monarch, is afraid. This is also implied by flattery in prayers: 


O Lord our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord 
of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost from thy throne behold 
all the dwellers upon earth: most heartily we beseech thee with thy 
favor to behold... 


The Western man who claims consciousness of oneness with God or 
the universe thus clashes with his society’s concept of religion. In most Asian 
cultures, however, such a man will be congratulated as having penetrated the 
true secret of life. He has arrived, by chance or by some such discipline as 
Yoga or Zen meditation, at a state of consciousness in which he experiences 
directly and vividly what our own scientists know to be true in theory. For the 
ecologist, the biologist, and the physicist know (but seldom feel) that every 
organism constitutes a single field of behavior, or process, with its environment. 
There is no way of separating what any given organism is doing from what its 
environment is doing, for which reason ecologists speak not of organisms in 
environments but organism-environments. Thus the words “I” or “self” should 
properly mean what the whole universe is doing at this particular “here-and- 
now” called John Doe. 

The kingly concept of God makes identity of self and God, or self and 
universe, inconceivable in Western religious terms. The difference between 
Eastern and Western concepts of man and universe, however, extends beyond 
strictly religious concepts. The Western scientist may rationally perceive the idea 
of organism-environment, but he does not ordinarily feel this to true. By cultural 
and social conditioning, he has been hypnotized into experiencing himself as 
an ego—as an isolated center of consciousness and will inside a bag of skin, 
confronting an external and alien world. We say, “I came into this world.” But 


292 PSYCHEDELICS 


we did nothing of the kind. We came out of it in just the same way as fruit 
comes out of trees. 

Such a vision of the universe clashes with the idea of a monarchical God, 
with the concept of the separate ego, and even with the secular, atheist-agnostic 
mentality, which derives its common sense from the mythology of nineteenth- 
century scientism. According to this view, the universe is a mindless mechanism 
and man a sort of accidental micro-organism infesting a minute globular rock 
that revolves about an unimportant star on the outer fringe of one of the minor 
galaxies. This “putdown” theory of man is extremely common among such 
quasi-scientists as sociologist, psychologists, and psychiatrists, most of whom 
are still thinking of the world in terms of Newtonian mechanics, and have 
never really caught up with the ideas of Einstein and Bohr, Oppenheimer and 
Schrédinger. Thus to the ordinary institutional-type psychiatrist, any patient who 
gives the least hint of mystical or religious experience is automatically diagnosed 
as deranged. From the standpoint of the mechanistic religion he is a heretic 
and is given electro-shock therapy as an up-to-date form of thumbscrew and 
rack. And, incidentally, it is just this kind of quasi-scientist who, as consultant 
to government and law-enforcement agencies, dictates official policies on the 
use of psychedelic chemicals. 

Inability to accept the mystic experience is more than an intellectual 
handicap. Lack of awareness of the basic unity of organism and environ- 
ment is a serious and dangerous hallucination. For in a civilization equipped 
with immense technological power, the sense of alienation between man and 
nature leads to the use of technology in a hostile spirit—to the “conquest” of 
nature instead of intelligent cooperation with nature. The result is that we are 
eroding and destroying our environment, spreading Los Angelization instead 
of civilization. This is the major threat overhanging Western technological 
culture, and no amount of reasoning or doom-preaching seems to help. We 
simply do not respond to the prophetic and moralizing techniques of conver- 
sion upon which Jews and Christians have always relied. But people have an 
obscure sense of what is good for them—call it “unconscious self-healing,” 
“survival instinct,” “positive growth potential,” or what you will. Among the 
educated young there is therefore a startling and unprecedented interest in the 
transformation of human consciousness. All over the Western world publishers 
are selling millions of books dealing with Yoga, Vedanta, Zen Buddhism, and 
the chemical mysticism of psychedelic drugs, and I have come to believe that 
the whole “hip” subculture, however misguided in some of its manifestations, is 
the earnest and responsible effort of young people to correct the self-destroying 
course of industrial civilization. 

The content of the mystical experience is thus inconsistent with both 
the religious and secular concepts of traditional Western thought. Moreover, 
mystical experiences often result in attitudes that threaten the authority not 
only of established churches but also of secular society. Unafraid of death and 


PSYCHEDELICS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 293 


deficient in worldly ambition, those who have undergone mystical experiences 
are impervious to threats and promises. Moreover, their sense of the relativ- 
ity of good and evil arouse the suspicion that they lack both conscience and 
respect for law. Use of psychedelics in the United States by a literate bourgeoisie 
means than an important segment of the population is indifferent to society’s 
traditional rewards and sanctions. 

In theory, the existence within our secular society of a group that does not 
accept conventional values is consistent with our political vision. But one of 
the great problems of the United States, legally and politically, is that we have 
never quite had the courage of our convictions. The republic is founded on 
the marvelously sane principle that a human community can exist and prosper 
only on a basis of mutual trust. Metaphysically, the American Revolution was 
a rejection of the dogma of Original Sin, which is the notion that because you 
cannot trust yourself or other people, there must be some Superior Authority 
to keep us all in order. The dogma was rejected because if it is true that we 
cannot trust ourselves and others, it follows that we cannot trust the Superior 
Authority that we ourselves conceive and obey, and that the very idea of our 
own untrustworthiness is unreliable! 

Citizens of the United States believe, or are supposed to believe, that a 
republic is the best form of government. Yet, vast confusion arises from trying 
to be republican in politics and monarchist in religion. How can a republic be 
the best form of government if the universe, heaven, and hell are a monarchy?’ 
Thus, despite the theory of government by consent, based upon mutual trust, 
the peoples of the United States retain, from the authoritarian backgrounds of 
their religions or national origins, an utterly naive faith in law as some sort of 
supernatural and paternalistic power. “There ought to be a law against it!” Our 
law-enforcement officers are therefore confused, hindered, and bewildered—not 
to mention corrupted—by being asked to enforce sumptuary laws, often of 
ecclesiastical origin, which vast numbers of people have no intention of obey- 
ing and, which, in any case, are immensely difficult or simply impossible to 
enforce—for example, the barring of anything so undetectable as LSD-25 from 
international and interstate commerce. 

There are two specific objections to use of psychedelic drugs. First, use 
of these drugs may be dangerous. However, every worthwhile exploration is 
dangerous—climbing mountains, testing aircraft, rocketing into outer space, 
skin diving, or collecting botanical specimens in jungles. But if you value 
knowledge and the actual delight of exploration more than mere duration of 
uneventful life, you are willing to take the risks. It is not really healthy for 
monks to practice fasting, and it was hardly hygienic for Jesus to get himself 
crucified, but these are risks taken in the course of spiritual adventures. Today 
the adventurous young are taking risks in exploring the psyche, testing their 
mettle at the task just as, in times past, they have tested it—more violently— 
in hunting, dueling, hot-rod racing, and playing football. What they need is 


294 PSYCHEDELICS 


not prohibitions and policemen but the most intelligent encouragement and 
advice that can be found. 

Second, drug use may be criticized as an escape from reality. However, this 
criticism assumes unjustly that the mystical experiences themselves are escap- 
ist or unreal. LSD, in particular, is by no means a soft and cushy escape from 
reality. It can very easily be an experience in which you have to test your soul 
against all the devils in hell. For me, it has been at times an experience in which 
I was at once completely lost in the corridors of the mind and yet relating that 
very lostness to the exact order of logic and language, simultaneously very mad 
and very sane. But beyond these occasional lost and insane episodes, there are 
the experiences of the world as a system of total harmony and glory, and the 
discipline of relating these to the order of logic and language must somehow 
explain how what William Blake called that “energy which is eternal delight” 
can consist with the misery and suffering of everyday life.° 

The undoubted mystical and religious intent of most users of the psyche- 
delics, even if some of these substances should be proved injurious to physi- 
cal health, requires that their free and responsible use be exempt from legal 
restraint in any republic that maintains a constitutional separation of Church 
and State. I mean “responsible” in the sense that such substances be taken by 
or administered to consenting adults only. The user of cannabis, in particular, 
is apt to have peculiar difficulties in establishing his “undoubtedly mystical 
and religious intent” in court. Having committed so loathsome and serious a 
felony, his chances of clemency are better if he assumes a repentant demeanor, 
which is quite inconsistent with the sincere belief that his use of cannabis was 
religious. On the other hand, if he insists unrepentantly that he looks upon 
such use as a religious sacrament, many judges will declare that they “dislike 
his attitude,” finding it truculent and lacking in appreciation of the gravity of 
the crime, and the sentence will be that much harsher. The accused is there- 
fore put in a “double-bind” situation in which he is “damned if he does, and 
damned if he doesn’t.” Furthermore, religious integrity—as in conscientious 
objection—is generally tested and established by membership in some church 
or religious organization with a substantial following. But the felonious status 
of cannabis is such that grave suspicion would be cast upon all individuals 
forming such an organization, and the test cannot therefore be fulfilled. It is 
generally forgotten that our guarantees of religious freedom were designed to 
protect precisely those who were not members of established denominations, 
but rather such screwball and (then) subversive individuals as Quakers, Shakers, 
Levellers, and Anabaptists. There is little question that those who use cannabis, 
or other psychedelics, with religious intent are now members of a persecuted 
religion that appears to the rest of society as a grave menace to “mental health,” 
as distinct from the old-fashioned “immortal soul,” but it’s the same old story. 

To the extent that mystical experience conforms with the tradition of 
genuine religious involvement, and to the extent that psychedelics induce that 


PSYCHEDELICS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 295 


experience, users are entitled to some constitutional protection. Also, to the 
extent that research in the psychology of religion can utilize such drugs, stu- 
dents of the human mind must be free to use them. Under present laws, I, as 
an experienced student of the psychology of religion, can no longer pursue 
research in the field. This is barbarous restriction of spiritual and intellectual 
freedom, suggesting that the legal system of the United States, is, after all, in 
tacit alliance with the monarchical theory of the universe and will, therefore, 
prohibit and persecute religious ideas and practices based on an organic and 
unitary vision of the universe.’

2. Thus Hinduism regards the universe, not as an artifact, but as an immense drama 
in which the One Actor (the paramatman or brahman) plays all the parts, which are his 
(or “its“) masks, or personae. The sensation of being only this one particular self, John 
Doe, is due to the Actor’s total absorption in playing this and every other part. For 
fuller exposition, see Radhakrishnan (1927) and Zimmer (1951, pp. 355-463). A popular 
version is in Watts (1966).

conscientious objection to military service. The implication was that the individual 
objector found himself bound to obey a higher echelon of command than the President

as Buddhists or naturalists, held an organic theory of the universe often had difficulty 
in obtaining recognition.

7. Amerindians belonging to the Native American Church, who employ the psyche- 
delic peyote cactus in their rituals, are firmly opposed to any government control of this 
plant, even if they should be guaranteed the right to its use. They feel that peyote is a 
natural gift of God to mankind, and especially to natives of the land where it grows, and 
that no government has the right to interfere with its use. The same argument might 
be made on behalf of cannabis, or the mushroom Psilocybe mexicana Heim. All these 
things are natural plants, not processed or synthesized drugs, and by what authority can 
individuals be prevented from eating them? There is no law against eating or growing 
the mushroom Amanita pantherina, even though it is fatally poisonous and only experts 
can distinguish it from a common edible mushroom. This case can be made even from 
the standpoint of believers in the monarchical universe of Judaism and Christianity, for 
it is a basic principle of both religions, derived from Genesis, that all natural substances 
created by God are inherently good, and all evil can arise only in their misuse. Thus 
laws against mere possession, or even cultivation, of these plants are in basic conflict 
with Biblical principles. Criminal conviction of those who employ these plants should 
be based on proven misuse. “And God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing 
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit 


296 PSYCHEDELICS 


of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.’ .. . And God saw everything that 
he had made, and, behold, it was very good” (Genesis 1:29, 31).

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE 


Ordinary Mind Is the Way (1971) 


n talking about experiences under the influence of lysergic acid 

(LSD-25) and other psychedelic chemicals, everyone must speak for 
himself. It is very hard to generalize, because the quality of these experiences 
depends only partially on the chemical reaction: of special importance are the 
mental state of the person taking such chemicals and the circumstances under 
which the experiment is conducted, that is to say, the set and the setting. 

Therefore, so far as I am concerned, I have found experiments with psy- 
chedelics both like and unlike what I understand as the flavor of Zen, and find 
them more akin to the approaches of Vajrayana. I say “approaches” advisedly, 
because I am sure that the culmination of Vajrayana, as exemplified in zog- 
chen meditation in the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism, is essentially 
the same as Zen. If there is any difference one would have to be experiencing 
nondualistic differences! 

As I have experienced them, the changes in consciousness stimulated by 
LSD go through a more-or-less regular pattern. There is first a slowing down 
of the sense of passing time. This moment becomes of supreme importance, 
and one seems able to savor its nuances to the utmost. In this state of mind, 
the future-oriented strivings of ordinary people seem to be somewhat insane: 
they appear frantic—missing the whole point of life—and for such people one 
feels sorrow rather than contempt. 

Next there are subtle changes in sense-perception. Colors become intensely 
bright and vivid. Sounds, especially of music, acquire astonishing resonance. Light 
seems to come from inside things—not to shine upon them from outside—and

the whole world acquires that peculiar luminosity that is normally seen at dawn 
and twilight. Both to sight and touch, objects seem to undulate or breathe, 
and it is difficult to decide whether this is a hallucination, or whether one 
has merely ceased to ignore some constant and normal input arising from the 
natural fluidity of our organs of sense. Perhaps a world sensed by a breathing 
organism should seem to breathe, except that ordinary consciousness screens 
out this impression because of its very constancy. At this stage, and for some 
time later during the total 8 to 10 hours of the experience, closing the eyes will 
reveal extraordinary visions of highly colored, arabesque-like designs, which, for 
me, have raised the question that I may be seeing patterns of energy related 
to the basic structure of my nerves. 

In the stage following, the “influence” passes into the thinking process, 
as if the chemical were spiraling through different levels of one’s being to get 
at the inmost center. Here, the discriminating mind is confounded because it 
becomes completely clear that all so-called opposites imply each other and 
go together in somewhat the same way as the two sides of a single coin. Yes 
indeed, form is very much emptiness, and emptiness is very much form! And 
the same goes for “self” and “other,” as also for what you do voluntarily and 
what happens to you involuntarily: it’s all the same process. Before, you may 
have known it intellectually, but now it comes to you with full clarity and cer- 
tainty that because you can’t experience the feeling “self” without the contrast 
of the feeling “other,” (or of solid without space) these supposed “opposites” 
imply each other mutually, and this leads on to recognition of the ji-ji-mu-ge 
principle that every identifiable thing or event implies and “goes with” all oth- 
ers, whether past, present, or future. 

But here there is a danger-point in the experience, especially for those who 
have not had previous training in Zen, Yoga, or some similar discipline. It may 
appear, on the one hand, that you are the helpless victim of everything that 
happens, a total puppet of fate. How can you trust it? What guarantee is there 
that you will be able to think and behave rationally five minutes from now? On 
the other hand, it may appear that you yourself, like God, are doing and are 
personally responsible for everything that happens. Paranoia or megalomania 
may result from siding with either aspect of this experience—in other words, 
from failing to see that these are two opposite ways of looking at the same 
state of affairs, the state of tzu-jan or shizen in which everything is happen- 
ing “of itself.” This, then, is liable to be the point at which the inexperienced 
experimenter with psychedelics is in real danger of a psychotic episode. He 
may get the feeling that there is absolutely nothing to be relied upon, for if 
all comes from impersonal fate, how is that to be trusted? And if all depends 
upon his own self . . . well, “when I look for it I can’t find it.” Nothing in this 
whole universe is more unreliable than ego. 

But if this stage is passed without panic—and the passage requires an attitude 
of profound faith or letting-go to you know not what—the rest of the experience 


ORDINARY MIND IS THE WAY 299 


is total delight, sat-chit-ananda, mahasukha, sambhoga. For there follows what, in 
Buddhist terms, would be called an experience of the world as dharmadhatu, 
of all things and events, however splendid or deplorable from relative points 
of view, as aspects of a symphonic harmony, which, in its totality, is gorgeous 
beyond all belief. And it is here that one may often have an apprehension of 
consciousness itself, of Mind, of the current inside the nervous-system, as vivid, 
electric-blue light such as is described in the Tibetan Bardo Thédol or in Hakuin 
Zenji’s vision of total transparency. 

But, in my own experience, the most interesting thing seems to happen just 
at the moment when the effect of the chemical wears off and you “descend” 
from these exalted and ecstatic experiences into your ordinary state of mind. 
For here, in “the twinkling of an eye,” there is the realization that so-called 
everyday or ordinary consciousness is the supreme form of awakening, of 
Buddha’s anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. It is so simple, so self-evident, so clear that 
nothing that makes any sense can be said about it. The problem vanishes, for 
the problem was the ever-impossible one of representing reality consistently in 
the forms of ideas and words, or of looking for something beyond and above 
this eternal here-and-now. This is where Zen language makes perfect sense. 
The ultimate meaning of Buddhism is MU!—or “the-sound-of-one-hand”—or 
my old worn-out sandals. 

Of course, if you arrive at this by using LSD you remember it quite clearly, 
but the true feeling of it passes off. It is thus that many of us who have experi- 
mented with psychedelic chemicals have left them behind, like the raft that 
you used to cross a river, and have found growing interest and even pleasure 
in the simplest practice of za-zen, which we perform like idiots, without any 
special purpose. Perhaps we are not overly impressed with the “attainments” 
and the “spiritual status” of great Zen-masters, but we deeply appreciate their 
ordinary way of life.

Psychology and Psychotherapy 


CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR 


Asian Psychology and Modern Psychiatry (1953)! 


A the basis of Asian culture there are certain traditions and ways of 
ife that have the outward appearance of religions. However, when 
one investigates such phenomena as the Vedanta, Yoga, Buddhism, and Taoism 
more deeply, and becomes familiar not so much with their popular application 
as with the thought and practice of their most advanced exponents, one discov- 
ers disciplines that are neither religion nor philosophy in the Western sense. 
For, unlike Christianity or Judaism, they only rarely involve “beliefs’—that is 
to say, adherence to positive, formulated opinions about the nature and destiny 
of man and the universe based on revelation or intuition. And, unlike Western 
philosophy, their modus operandi is only quite secondarily the construction of a 
verbal and logical description or explanation of man’s experience. 

Oriental “philosophy” is, at root, not concerned with conceptions, ideas, 
opinions, and forms of words at all. It is concerned with a transformation of 
experience itself, and it would seem that one of the things most akin to it in 
Western culture—akin by form rather than content—is psychotherapy. For 
this is the one major area in which the West has developed disciplines that 
aim at transforming the actual processes of the mind, and, through them, of 
the ways in which we experience the world, usually without commitment to 
any metaphysical or philosophical theory. Thus the curing of a psychotic or 
neurotic person, the transformation of the way in which he thinks and feels, 
is to a large extent the best Western analogy of the special concerns of Ori- 
ental philosophy. In many respects, then, it is more accurate to speak of such

304 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


a phenomenon as Buddhism as psychology, rather than philosophy or religion. 
But this requires at least two reservations: that in popular practice it has many 
of the characteristics of a religion, and that its ultimate concerns are, as yet, 
hardly within the scope of Western psychology. 

From the outset, there is one notable difference between the “psycho- 
therapy,” the transformation of the mind, envisaged by an Oriental psychology, 
on the one hand, and Western psychiatry, on the other. In the West we are 
chiefly preoccupied with the transformation of mental states that are peculiar 
to relatively few individuals, and that arise out of certain special conditioning 
circumstances of the individual’s history. But Asian psychology interests itself 
in the transformation of states that are common to mankind as a whole, and is 
thus, as it were, a psychotherapy of the “normal” man. It proposes to change 
patterns of thought and feeling that are characteristic of the society as well as 
of the individual, though this does not amount in practice to an attempt to 
change the society as a whole. For it is recognized that in any given society 
relatively few individuals seem to have the capacity and the interest to liberate 
themselves from patterns of conditioning common to all. 

It follows that for an Oriental psychology, “normalcy” could never be a 
standard of mental health—where “normalcy” means the ways of thinking and 
feeling, the conventions and life-goals, acceptable to the majority of persons in 
a particular culture. Likewise, the diseases of the mind are not recognized in 
terms of deviation from the normal. From this (Oriental) standpoint, there is 
a clear absurdity in trying to achieve the “happy adjustment” of an individual 
to the conventions of a society that is largely composed of unhappy people. 
Thus an Oriental psychology such as Buddhism is concerned, not with the 
peculiar frustrations of the neurotic individual, but with the general frustra- 
tion, the common unhappiness (duhkha in Sanskrit), which afflicts almost every 
member of the society. 

Buddhist and Hindu psychology agree in ascribing this general unhappiness 
to avidya—the Sanskrit term for a special type of ignorance or unconscious- 
ness, which is the failure to perceive that certain desires and activities are self- 
contradictory and “viciously circular.” The victims of avidya are thus described 
as being in the state of samsara—the “round” or “whirl”—a life pattern that, 
having set itself a self-contradictory goal, resolves or oscillates interminably to 
the increasing discomfiture of those involved. Thus self-contradiction rather than 
deviation from the cultural norm becomes the criterion of mental disease, for 
which reason this basic difference between Oriental and Western psychology 
requires some explanation. 

Self-contradiction is technically described in Buddhist and Hindu psychol- 
ogy as the human mind in a state of dvaita, which is duality or dividedness, 
a concept rather more inclusive than the approximate Western equivalent of 
“internal conflict.” One of the simplest examples of dvaita and its attendant 


ASIAN PSYCHOLOGY AND MODERN PSYCHIATRY 305 


self-contradiction is the making of one’s life-goal the acquisition of pleasure 
and the avoidance of pain. It is pointed out that pleasure and pain are relative 
experiences, such that a life consisting wholly or even principally of pleasure is 
as far beyond any possibility of experience as a world in which “everything is 
up” and nothing down. To the degree that one avoids pain one also eliminates 
pleasure, and so achieves a way of life that is merely indifferent and boring. 
Consequently a life devoted to the pursuit of pleasure or happiness is devoted to 
a self-contradictory goal, because, in so far as one succeeds in gaining pleasure, 
there is necessarily a proportionate increase in some form of pain—often the 
simple, but most unpleasant, anxiety of losing what one has gained. 

Buddhist psychology, in particular, emphasizes as perhaps the major form 
of self-contradiction a division of experience into subject and object, thinker 
and thought, feeler and feeling. According to Buddhist psychology, the notion 
that “I” am in some way different from the feelings that I now feel or the 
thought that I now think, the notion that man’s psycho-organism contains an 
ego as the enduring subject of a changing panorama of sensations, is an illusion 
based on memory (smrti). The notion of the ego arises because of the apparent 
phenomenon of self-consciousness, of knowing that one knows, or feeling that 
one feels. But it is pointed out that, in fact, we are never actually self-conscious. 
While thought A exists, we are not aware that we are aware of thought A. “I 
am aware that I am aware of thought A” is no longer thought A, but thought 
B. Every attempt to be aware of being aware is an infinite regress, a vicious 
circle, like trying to bite one’s own teeth. Thought B is not thought A; it is the 
memory of having had thought A, so that one is never aware of an ego that 
actually “has” (tense present) an experience. There are simply memory-traces 
of past experiences, and these suggest a continuous ego as a whirled light sug- 
gests a continuous circle of fire. 

Thus the self or ego of which we claim to be conscious is in fact an 
abstraction from memory. The real substratum or content of the ego-experience 
is the memory of what has been, and not the knowledge of what is. In fact, 
then, I am not different from my present complex of thought-feeling-sensation. 
The difference between “I” and “my experience” is a misinterpretation of the 
difference between two kinds of experience—memory and immediate aware- 
ness. In fact, there is no “I” apart from the present, immediate experience. But 
contradiction arises when we try to make the abstract, conventional, and actu- 
ally nonexistent “I” do something. For example, let us suppose that the present 
feeling is one of acute anxiety. If I “feel” that, apart from this anxiety, there is 
some separate, subjective ego that “has” this state of mind, efforts of will are 
made to fight the anxiety or to escape from it; the “I” is opposed to the anxiety. 
The result, however, is the familiar vicious circle of worry, because the effort 
to get rid of the anxiety is not the work of some independent, controlling “I”: 
it is the anxiety itself—in a state of self-contradiction that only aggravates it. 


306 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


THE “EGO” AS AN ABSTRACTION 


But when it is realized that in fact there is no “I” to be rescued from anxiety, 
there follows a psychic relaxation in which the anxiety itself subsides. This real- 
ization is not, of course, a matter of mere theoretical perception, for it arises, 
not so much through intellectual self-analysis, as through a total awareness 
(samyaksmrti) of what and how one actually feels now. Buddhist “psychotherapy” 
values nothing more than simple attention to the actual, immediate content of 
sensation and feeling—as distinct from the verbalized abstractions that thought 
constructs about it. Thus it is understood that “ego” is an abstraction, and not 
a content of the immediately perceived world. It is a convenient abstraction 
if treated, like the equator, as imaginary. But if treated as real, as an effective 
agent, it is only a source of confusion and psychic self-contradiction. 

From the foregoing it might seem that there is one respect in which Bud- 
dhist psychology contradicts itself. It states that the pursuit of pleasure and 
the flight from pain is an illusory and impossible life-goal, and yet it proposes 
a deliverance from the “general unhappiness” called duhkha. This reveals an 
important aspect of the technique of Buddhist psychology. Stated verbally and 
formally its “goal” is release from duhkha, but in actual practice it dispenses 
with psychological goals entirely. “Goal” implies futurity, and the object of 
Buddhist psychology is not future. The object is complete attention to what 
one feels now, complete presence of mind. This involves the falling away of any 
notion of a psychological goal, because it dissipates the sense of the “I” distinct 
from the present feeling, and hence of the possibility of changing or escaping 
from it. Finding itself “trapped,” totally unable to choose to be other than the 
“now-state” of the mind, the “I” gives up or expires (nirvana). But this is a case 
of stirb und werde (die and come to life), of the familiar paradox of the law of 
reversed effort, of the creative freedom that comes through “self-surrender.” 

In our seminar, participants trained in some forms of Western psycho- 
therapy often objected that this “surrender” of the ego would imply the mere 
abandonment of the psyche to the lawless direction of the unconscious, and 
that it was an attempted reversion to the undifferentiated state of “primitive 
mentality” in which the conscious and the unconscious are still confused. But 
such an objection rests on a confusion between “ego” and “consciousness.” For 
in practice this dissipation of the ego comes about, not through unconscious- 
ness, but through very intense consciousness, through the clearest awareness of 
the present realities of psychic life. Furthermore, the various types of Oriental 
psychology are not at all afraid of the “lawless direction” of an “unconscious,” 
which has become capable of so great a clarity of consciousness. This may 
sound paradoxical if it is not understood that in Oriental psychologies such as 
the Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist the unconscious is recognized as the source 
of consciousness, as that which is conscious. There should be no difficulty in 
understanding this when put into its simple physical parallel: we are conscious 


ASIAN PSYCHOLOGY AND MODERN PSYCHIATRY 307 


with the brain but not of the brain. We simply do not know how we are con- 
scious, how we remember, how we reason, abstract, and perceive gestalten. We 
only know that the autonomic nervous system, for example, effects miracles 
of organization so complex that the conscious intellect is baffled in attempt- 
ing to understand them. Oriental psychology feels, then, that the direction of 
life is basically from those unconscious processes that have thus far organized 
the marvelous complexity of the human form, and that constellate not only 
the autonomic nervous system but consciousness, memory, and reason itself. 
One might ask, then, what directions we are to trust if we cannot trust these! 

The following quotations from the Chinese Taoist philosopher Chuang-Tzu 
(c. 400 B.C.) aptly express the Oriental attitude to this unconscious process (Tao): 


Your body is not your own: it is the delegated image of Tao. Your life 
is not your own: it is the delegated harmony of Tao. Your individuality 
is not your own: it is the delegated adaptability of Tao. You move, 
you know not how; you are at rest, you know not why. These are the 
operations of the laws of Tao. 

Things are produced around us, but no one knows the whence. 
They issue forth, but no one sees the portal. Men one and all value 
that part of knowledge which is known. They do not know how to 
avail themselves of the unknown in order to reach knowledge. Is not 
this misguided? 


Tao is not “God” in the personified or conceptualized sense of the West—not 
a definite thing, but a negative concept analogous to the unconscious. Chuang- 
Tzu’s mentor, Lao-Tzu, said: “The Tao which can be defined (lit., tao-ed, made 
its own object) is not the regular Tao.” Tao is thus the total process of life that 
cannot be defined nor made conscious because no standpoint of observation 
exists outside it. 

The foregoing considerations, which were but a few of the topics reviewed 
in our seminar, suggested two points of application for Western psychotherapy. 
The first was the therapeutic value of the subjective abandonment of any psy- 
chological goals, in the future, coupled with the gentle but persistent focusing 
of attention on the immediately present totality of feeling-sensation—without 
any attempt to explain, diagnose, judge, or change it. Oriental psychologies 
do not particularly value rationalized explanations of how a person has come 
to feel the way he feels, in terms of his past history and conditioning. They 
do not stress the idea that the perception or understanding of a causal chain, 
running from the past to the present, effects release from it. For the task of 
unraveling the conditioning of the present by the past is infinite, since it leads 
not only to conditioning of the child by parents, but also to the conditioning 
of the parents—and the child—by their entire social context. By such means, 
a thorough psychoanalysis would have to go back to Adam and Eve! 


308 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


WESTERN “WRONG-AWARENESS” 


Their feeling is rather that we are conditioned unconsciously by the past because 
of an incomplete and incorrect awareness of the present. Such “wrong-awareness” 
(avidya) underlies, in their opinion, one of the basic assumptions of Western 
thought and science: namely, the whole notion that the past contains the entire 
explanation of the present, that the understanding of what-is-now is complete 
in its mere history. For Oriental thought, the past exists only conventionally. 
It has no real existence, being a logical inference from present memory—an 
abstraction, and not a real, concrete experience. Therapy consists in releasing 
the mind from treating the abstract as the concrete, without, however, losing 
the power of abstraction. 

The second point of application goes hand-in-hand with the first. Clear 
awareness, clear feeling, of one’s real and present experience involves, as we 
saw, the realization that the ego—the continuing “I” as the substratum of 
changing experiences—is an abstraction and thus not an effective agent.’ It 
can no more perform an action or effect a psychological change than, say, an 
inch or the number three. Yet Western science, and especially applied science 
(technology), is based on the assumption that its immediate objective is always 
the understanding and control of the environment by the ego. Western culture 
as a whole rests on the feeling that man, as ego, is the independent observer 
and potential controller of a world that he experiences as profoundly other than 
himself. Yet it is for this reason that Western technology leads us repeatedly 
into vicious circles. For if this split between the ego and the environment is 
unreal, the whole effort of technology is like the attempt of a hand to grasp 
itself. Its ultimate issue is the (almost) totally controlled or planned society— 
the totalitarian state—which is precisely the breakdown of society because it 
is based on mutual mistrust. It is the maximum effort of everyone to control 
everyone and everything else. “Am I my brother’s policeman?” 

Generally speaking, psychiatry shares most of the unexamined assumptions 
of Western science. Thus it tends to represent the unconscious as a mass of 
irrational and chaotic “drives” that have to be organized and controlled by the 
ego, the conscious. However, the method of control is not that of Protestant 
Puritanism or Catholic moral theology—the method of whip and spur. It 
is the much improved method of the humane horse-trainer, who “loves his 
animals” and gently coaxes them into obedience with lumps of sugar rather 
than whippings. But from the standpoint of Oriental psychology this is still a 
quasi-schizoid state of mind. It gives inadequate practical recognition to the fact 
that consciousness is a function of the unconscious, however much this may be 
admitted in theory. Man is not dual, the horse and its rider. The relationship of 
conscious and unconscious is perhaps better represented by the centaur. For it 
is surely absurd to conceive the unconscious as an unintelligence, a generator 
of nothing but colossal blind urges with which “we” must somehow come to 


ASIAN PSYCHOLOGY AND MODERN PSYCHIATRY 309 


terms, for we do not actually know how we reason or “will,” or attain creative 
insight—which is only to say that these are, at root, unconscious functions. 


“INSPIRED SPONTANEITY” 


The second point of application is, then, a recognition of the fact that therapy 
is not the increase of conscious control over the unconscious by the ego. It is 
rather an integration of conscious and unconscious, preparatory to a type of 
living, thinking, and acting, which in Zen Buddhism is called mushin (mu “no,” 
shin “mind’). Mushin is a kind of “inspired spontaneity.” It is the art of making 
the appropriate responses to life without the interruption of that wobbling and 
indecisive state that we call “choosing.” In other words, mushin is when acts 
and decisions are “handed over” to the same unconscious processes, which 
organize the ingenious structure of the body. Ordinarily, our breathing, circula- 
tion, hearing, and seeing all happen mushin—without the necessity of conscious 
direction and control. But there are also times when we make a witty remark 
or get an extremely important idea by the same mysterious process. We did 
not “try”; it just “came.” 

Buddhist psychology proposes to facilitate this process to the point where 
inspired spontaneity is not the exceptional but the usual mode of thought and 
action. But as in many other arts, this comes about through a process of growth 
and a subtle kind of “effortless discipline.” It is by no means to be confused 
with acting wildly—saying or doing the first thing that comes into one’s head. 
Yet thinking or acting “wild” or at random is indeed the starting point, though, 
like free-association in the analyst’s office, it occurs in a context (i.e., some sort 
of ashram or school) where the resultant vagaries are accepted. In due course, 
one learns to use mushin as a way of action just as one learns the use of any 
other instrument or faculty, which, at first try, seems erratic and unreliable.’ 

In Western psychology, free-association—the nearest thing to mushin—has 
a different objective. The Freudian or Jungian analyst is primarily interested in 
what associations, symbols, and other diagnostic materials are produced in free- 
association. It is a way of exploring the unconscious in order to control it. In 
Buddhist psychology the point of interest is rather that spontaneous images and 
symbols are produced. The preliminary vagaries of mushin are not analyzed, 
for mushin is being brought into play as a way of life rather than a diagnostic 
technique. Herein, I believe, is reflected the wide difference between Eastern 
and Western psychology, the one trusting the unconscious and attempting to 
liberate the full depth of its wisdom, and the other trying to arrange a treaty 
wherein the unconscious accepts the control of the ego in return for certain 
recognition of its blind demands. But there are many signs that this difference is 
decreasing. Of late many of us have noted the growth of a remarkable humil- 
ity and readiness to admit ignorance in Western psychiatric circles. For in the 
course of scientific research there is a long preliminary stage of rapid progress 


310 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


and easy overconfidence, until a point is reached where every addition to our 
knowledge reveals, at the same time, a new universe of ignorance. Through 
such knowledge we come to the place of which Chuang-Tzu said, “He who 
knows that he is a fool is not a great fool.” 


NOTES 


1. This article arose out of an experimental seminar on “The Application of Asian 
Psychology to Modern Psychiatry,” conducted during 1951 at the American Academy 
of Asian Studies in San Francisco under the direction of three members of the faculty: 
Frederic Spiegelberg, PhD, Haridas Chaudhuri, PhD, and the author. Dr. Spiegelberg is 
director of Studies at the Academy, and assistant professor in the Department of Asi- 
atic and Slavic Studies at Stanford University. Dr. Chaudhuri was, before coming to the 
Academy, professor of philosophy at Krishnagar Government College in India, and is a 
noted exponent of the philosophy of the late Sri Aurobindo Ghose. Alan W. Watts is a 
professor at the Academy in the field of comparative philosophy and psychology, and 
author of many books on East-West relations in religion, philosophy, and psychology, 
including The Spirit of Zen (1936), The Meaning of Happiness (1940), The Supreme Identity 
(1950), and The Wisdom of Insecurity (1951). He is now working on a research fellowship 
in Oriental Philosophy under the Bollingen Foundation. 

In a note to the [Journal] editor, Dr. Watts writes, “You will recognize, of course, 
that this is an enormous subject, such that in eleven-and-a-half typewritten pages I 
have only been able to sketch some of the general issues. I would have liked to have 
had space to give adequate recognition to the fact that there are many exceptions to 
some of my generalizations about Western psychiatry. But just because these are still 
exceptional, I felt it might be better to omit them in an article dealing with preliminary, 
large-scale considerations.” 

2. It must be understood that we are not here using the term “I” or “ego” to 
designate the total human organism. In ordinary speech, as well as in psychological 
jargon, they are seldom so used, but refer rather to a supposed center of consciousness 
for which other parts of the organism, such as the glands or the limbs, are objects that 
the “T” has or uses.

1949). Interesting discussions of the same phenomenon from the standpoint of Western 
psychology will be found in three articles by E. D. Hutchinson (1939, 1940, and 1941).

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE 


Convention, Conflict, and Liberation 


Further Observations on Asian Psychology 
and Modern Psychiatry (1956) 


hen we compare some of the trends in modern psychotherapy 

with certain practical disciplines of Asian philosophy, we begin 
to discover a most instructive clarification of the whole function of therapy, 
and especially of its relation to social institutions. Among social institutions 
we must understand conventions of every type; not only the family, marriage, 
legal codes, and systems of language, but also ideas of motion, time, space 
and personality, which are generally understood to be properties of the physi- 
cal world rather than conventions of social origin.' But it would seem that the 
rigorous procedures of mathematics and physics are confirming the intuition 
of Indian and Chinese thinkers as to the essentially conventional character of 
our conceptions of the physical world. 

In Indian philosophy the world as we conceive it is termed maya—a much 
misunderstood word derived from the Sanskrit root matr—, “to measure,” and 
from which we have in turn derived such words as meter, matrix, and mate- 
rial. Stated rather baldly, the theory of maya is that the world as we conceive 
it is a mental construct as distinct from an “objective” reality. This is not to be 
confused with Western views of subjective idealism. It is rather the more eas- 
ily verifiable notion that the world as we conceive it (e.g., as a multiplicity of 
“things” in relative motion) is not to be identified with the world as it is, in the 
same way that one does not identify the measure with what is measured. One 
does not confuse the cloth with the yard, since it would be impossible to make 
clothing from merely abstract yards. Thus a person is said to be spellbound by

maya when he confuses the concrete with the abstract, when he is hypnotized 
into believing that the world of immediate experience is precisely the system 
of concepts (vikalpa) and measures that he employs to manipulate that world, 
and to make reconstructions of it in terms of the symbols of thought. These 
concepts and measures are our social institutions, and include, as here defined, 
so-called laws of nature, ideas of “human nature,” of matter, of things, and 
of events—all of which are held to be fundamentally arbitrary conventions of 
measurement and classification into which the real world is “fitted” as water is 
poured into jars, bottles and conduits of varying shapes and uses. 

It is as if the real world corresponded to the amorphous ink blot of the 
Rorschach Test, and the world-as-conceived to the picture that the subject proj- 
ects upon it. The actual ink blot is satyam or brahman, the immeasurable reality, 
and in this case the “blot” includes both the perceiver and the perceived. The 
subject’s projection upon the blot is maya, but in this case the subject—every 
individual in a society—does not fabricate his own projection. He learns it 
from society in the course of his upbringing, and is taught to regard it, not as 
a projection, but as “what really is.” 

In every society, Western and Eastern, upbringing and education is the 
process of learning the conventions, a process that entails many types of dif- 
ficulty and conflict. For social conventions are like the bed of Procrustes: those 
too short for it have to be stretched, and those too long have to be cut down. 
Since all these conventions are in some sense types of language, of symbolic 
classification and representation of the world, the difficulties in learning them 
are the same as those encountered in mastering the complex vocabulary and 
grammar of an unfamiliar tongue. 

Here are two immediate sources of conflict. Because every system of 
“language” is an attempt to represent the world in terms of a static and usu- 
ally linear system of signs, it appears that the world is, in itself, frustratingly 
complex. But the complexity lies in the language rather than the reality, and is 
analogous to the complexity of trying to drink water with a fork. Nothing is 
simpler than to breathe; it becomes complex only when one tries to represent 
how it is done in communicable signs, that is, to think about it. Furthermore, 
all such systems must of necessity have a static—because generally accepted— 
character that makes the real world appear bewilderingly changeable. 

Conventional systems necessarily involve rather rigid conceptions of what 
man is, whether as the knowing subject or ego, as possessing a human nature 
with more-or-less fixed and “proper” characteristics, or as having a defined role 
in society that the individual is obliged to identify with “himself.” Such concepts 
do not necessarily correspond with what we feel ourselves to be, in ways that we 
cannot easily formulate.” This, together with misunderstandings as to what the 
rules of the system are supposed to be, leads to the most excruciating conflicts 
between the individual and the system, or rather, between the individual’s ver- 
sion of what he is and his version of what the system requires of him. To the 


CONVENTION, CONFLICT, AND LIBERATION 313 


extent that he identifies the rules of the system with the laws of nature, or of 
God, he feels himself to be at odds with reality itself, and to be faced with the 
choice of an intolerable submission or foolhardy rebellion against “iron facts.” 

Still another source of conflict is that the confusion of the abstract formu- 
lation with the concrete reality leads to the pursuit of goals that, because they 
exist in the abstract alone, cannot be attained or do not give satisfaction when 
attained. The ideal of a state of pleasure or happiness unalloyed with pain, or 
the goal of success, of wealth measured in the symbolic terms of money, are 
obvious examples of such abstract mirages. So, too, are life-goals conceived 
in terms of future time, as in the feeling that life is insupportable without a 
promising future, however agreeable the immediate present. 

The idea of motion in time is perhaps the most problematic of all con- 
ventions, since it appears to be at once the source of our highest culture and 
our deepest misery. It is not difficult to see that there is an important sense in 
which only the present is real, even though constantly eluding our grasp. There 
seems to be no way of measuring it, of determining how “long” it lasts, and 
it cannot be regarded as infinitesimally “short” since this would seem to make 
any experience of it impossible. Likewise we feel that the present experience 
cannot be held in consciousness, and the more we try to retain it, the more we 
are aware of its evanescence. But this appears to be a special case of the whole 
problem of trying to define or measure the real world in terms of conventional 
structures. The problem of defining or grasping the present is essentially the 
same as that of trying to write a law without loopholes, or of formulating an 
exhaustively accurate description of a simple event. 

By the convention of time we identify ourselves, collectively and individu- 
ally, with history, with a linear series of past events projected into a future. 
This series is conventional not only in the sense that the present alone has 
actuality, but also in that the events constituting the history are a selection of 
“significant” events from an infinite possibility, just as there are infinitely many 
ways of projecting pictures into the Rorschach ink blots. To be identified with 
a history is to be identified with an abstraction, and thus to have the constant, 
gnawing sense that one lacks reality, that one is perpetually and ineluctably 
“falling apart,” that one is everlastingly inadequate. But the definition, the 
description, is always inadequate to the reality. Therefore, to be identified with 
such an abstraction (e.g., a social role), or, worse, to be in search of security in 
terms of such an abstraction, is to be self-condemned to inadequacy. 

The foregoing may sound as if social conventions were under attack. On 
the contrary, they are the sine qua non of human communication, the founda- 
tions of all culture. But, like every useful and creative instrument, they involve 
costs and dangers. There is certainly no doubt that every member of society 
must be disciplined in its conventions. But it must be recognized that the dis- 
ciplinary process brings about inner conflicts, and almost inevitably warps the 
indefinable naturalness and spontaneity that every adult envies in the child.’ 


314 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


Therefore certain Asian societies provide optional means for relieving people 
of the warping effects of their acculturation and upbringing, which give them 
inward liberation (moksha) from the conventions that they have been compelled 
to learn. This liberation is, however, utterly different from rebellion against the 
conventions, since rebellion always implies a bondage to that against which one 
rebels. Liberation enables a man to be the master instead of the slave of his 
social conventions, and requires not that he condemn them as wrong, but that 
he “see through them” as arbitrary, like the rules of the game. 

The process of acculturation and liberation is reflected in the outward 
structure of ancient Hindu society. The society as such consisted of four castes 
or role-groups: brahmana (priesthood), kshatriya (temporal power), vaishya 
(merchant), and shudra (laborer). By virtue of membership in one of these 
castes an individual possessed an identity. But, whenever he had completed his 
responsibilities, he might abandon caste to follow the way of liberation, giving 
up his identity and becoming a sanyassin, or homeless monk. The sanyassin was 
an “upper outlaw,” just as the Untouchable was a “lower outlaw,” for as the 
latter was beneath the law the former was above it. Ideally, the sanyassin was 
a jivan-mukta—one who, though still appearing to be an individual from the 
standpoint of social convention (maya), is from his own standpoint “no one,” 
since he no longer identifies himself with a role, a persona, but with concrete 
reality, which is nonconceptual (nirvikalpa).* 

In Chinese society, the process of acculturation is represented by Confu- 
cianism, and of liberation by Taoism or Buddhism, since the typical Taoist is 
the old man who has retired from the world to live alone in the mountains. 


I will cast out Wisdom and reject Learning. 
My thoughts shall wander in the Great Void. 
(Chi K’ang, A.D. 223-262, as cited in Waley, 1947) 


In common with the sanyassin, the Taoist sage is a superior outlaw who has 
freed his mind from distinctions, from good and evil, life and death, pleasure 
and pain. But the Chinese view differs from the Indian in that the sage need not 
necessarily abandon his worldly duties, for as “king without and sage within” he 
can continue in outward observance of the conventions though inwardly free 
from their compulsions. “If the mind is without wind and waves, everywhere 
are blue mountains and green trees” (Saikontan, 291).’ 

In Chinese and Indian culture the “superior outlaw” was in the social order 
but not of it in the sense that society itself usually recognized him and even 
honored him. For the culture admitted the relativity and the limitations of its 
own conventions, and could assent in theory to the validity of a viewpoint 
beyond its understanding, as one might extrapolate an outside to a closed space 
of which one knows only the inside boundaries. But the cultures of the West, 
both Christian and secular, have never really had a place for the “upper outlaw,” 


CONVENTION, CONFLICT, AND LIBERATION 315 


a fact that has surprisingly far-reaching and disastrous results. Christian theology 
has persistently identified the system of conventions—the moral order—not 
only with the will but also with the very nature of the Absolute, and has been 
resolutely opposed to any idea of God as beyond good and evil. The secular 
cultures of the West are in an even worse state, for having abandoned the 
belief in God there remains absolutely nothing but the system of conventions. 
Thus the secular state recognizes nothing outside its jurisdiction, nothing that 
“is not Caesar's.” The Church admitted a degree of supra-conventionality in 
God through the doctrine of his infinite love and forgiveness. Behind the Law 
stood the Person who made the Law, an understanding heart rather than a 
blind principle. But the secular state cannot admit anything higher than Law, 
and thus is ever in danger of becoming a mechanism without mercy. 

To identify the system of conventions with the Absolute is to weight them 
with excessive authority, and is actually a danger to the system, somewhat as an 
electric wire will burn out when the current is too strong for it. The Western 
mind seems to have difficulty in thinking in other terms than extremes—true or 
false, right or wrong—and thus finds it hard to see that a conventional principle 
can be true and important without being absolutely true and absolutely impor- 
tant. Thus when there arise between the man and system, the types of conflict 
described above there is no release save through catastrophic revolt against the 
whole system. But such revolutions “throw out the baby with the bath water,” 
and usually establish worse tyrannies than those that they remove, since they 
go to the opposite extreme, and every extreme is a tyranny. 

This Asian parallel suggests, then, that the most important function of a 
psychotherapy is to deliver people from the inevitable warping and the inevi- 
table violence done to them in the course of their upbringing and education. 
It is not simply to ease the process of acculturation for intractable individuals, 
to “adjust them to the group.” We must recognize that acculturation is at 
once a blessing and a curse, that it is both a necessity and a positively splendid 
achievement, which, however, entails the price of damage and danger. But as 
meat salted for preservation may be unsalted for eating, so the wise society 
provides a cure for the ill effects of social discipline—an initiation, a therapy, 
for the fully cultured adult, which releases him from compulsive identification 
with the system of conventions. 

One may ask whether Western psychotherapy is in a position to fulfill this 
function. In some respects it begins to be so, as, for example, in its emphasis 
on self-acceptance and in its faith in the self-healing properties of the psyche. 
But its official “schools” seem, as yet, to have a long way to go, and this not 
only because of the still prevalent notion that its role is to provide adjustment 
to social norms. The chief difficulty is that the standard systems of psycho- 
therapy—Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian, as well as the more physiologically 
oriented systems of “orthodox” psychiatry—are still all too unconscious of 
their own identification with some of the more basic social conventions. One 


316 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


might say that these systems have an unanalyzed Unconscious whose contents 
are primarily intellectual, consisting of unexamined assumptions and premises 
derived from the philosophy and scientific theory of the nineteenth century. 
These include those conceptions of time, motion, causality, progress, history, 
and human nature that appear all too easily to be laws of nature rather than 
conventions of thought. For many years it has been fashionable to underrate the 
power of ideas as factors in producing neurosis, and the emphasis has been laid 
on the traumatic experiences of childhood, a fashion reflecting the theoretical 
assumption that physiology is more “real” than ideology. But the therapist can 
no longer neglect the force of ideas, and especially of unconsciously accepted 
ideas. He must be a philosophical analyst as well as a psychoanalyst—and this 
he cannot be unless he is himself philosophically “analyzed.” He must be able 
to reveal the conflicts arising from the patient’s unconscious self-identification 
with his conventional history, with his identity in time, with his conventionally 
delineated “body,”® and with many other conceptual entities. 

Little can be done in this direction unless Western thought can overcome 
its characteristic fear that the only alternative to the conventional systems is 
total chaos. Thus many readers of the above may have formed the impression 
that the real, concrete, and nonconceptual world (corresponding in our analogy 
to the Rorschach blot) is in fact a disorder, a lawless and directionless waste- 
land. But this, again, is but another symptom of unconscious acceptance of a 
conventional pattern of thought that provides “con” as the only alternative to 
“pro.” Both order and disorder belong to maya, to the category of conceptual 
projections upon a real world that altogether escapes the dualistic definitions 
of our thinking. Thus the one indispensable prerequisite for a therapy of this 
kind is the realization that man’s concrete identity can never be an object of 
formal knowledge, definition, and control. This realization forces him into a 
psychological trap where nature—in her kindness—virtually compels him to 
see that he has no other alternative than a leap into the dark. And this is that 
“leap of faith” that is essential to every creative action: not belief in a formally 
defined God or philosophical dogma, but trust in that most concrete unknown 
that is the atman, the actual self.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX 


Eternity as the Unrepressed Body (1959) 


he work of Sigmund Freud and his disciples is one of the most 

striking examples of the miscarriage of the romantic and naturalist 

movements of the nineteenth century. For it was presumably the intention of 
these movements to bring man to himself by overcoming the ancient dualism 
of mind and body, spirit and matter, reason and instinct, which for so long had 
been the religious and philosophical expression of the human being’s mistrust 
of himself. Selfconsciousness has almost always involved the dilemma and the 
vicious circle of every delicate system of control: quis custodiet custodies—who 
guards the guards, or rather, how do we control the controller, particularly 
when the controlled and the controller are one? How can man govern his bodily 
appetites if his mind and will are the same as his body? How can a hand hold 
onto itself? The problem seemed to be solved if man could be considered a 
duality—a mind in a body like a driver in a car. This was all very well so long 
as the controlling mind, soul, will, or ego could be trusted. But one of the 
main insights of Christianity, of Jesus, St. Paul, and St. Augustine, was that the 
root of evil lay in the spiritual sphere, in the perversion of the controlling will. 
This insight actually destroyed the usefulness of the soul-body dualism, 
though it was not effectively questioned until the materialistic and naturalistic 
viewpoints of nineteenth-century science suggested a theory of man in which 
mind and will could be considered as operations of the body. Freud played an 
enormous part in constructing this unitary view of man. From his early days 
he had been convinced that mental processes could ultimately be explained in 
terms of neurology, but his contribution to the unitary view was not to lie along

these lines. It came through psychology, through a reduction of the motivations 
of the conscious will to irrational bodily instincts, or at least to instincts that 
had always been associated with flesh rather than spirit. 

But this unitary, naturalistic view of man miscarried in a number of ways. 
It seemed impossible to take it seriously since for all practical purposes human 
beings had to feel themselves to be conscious wills directing and mastering 
nature both inside and outside their own organisms. Through the technology 
that arose from nineteenth-century science, men succeeded in controlling nature 
as never before, and this very success confirmed the feeling that, more and 
more, the rational will has to stand in opposition to natural spontaneity, and 
that the future development of man can no longer be left to the unmanaged 
process by which our species, our brains, and our consciousness have evolved. 
Here, at once, is seen the difference between the theory of evolution and the 
idea of human progress that the theory was originally supposed to justify. Evo- 
lution was the result of spontaneous natural selection; progress, of controlled 
mechanical direction. The terminology of man’s separation from his body and 
his physical environment had changed, but the feeling, and modes of action 
expressing it, became stronger than ever. Scientific objectivity became the new 
distance between man and his nature. 

In Freud and psychoanalysis this miscarriage is the more remarkable just 
because it was Freud’s discovery that mental disease came about through man’s 
repression of his own nature, and especially of that erotic energy that Freud 
felt to be the basic character of all living matter. Psychoanalysis, if it was to 
be something more than a system of investigation and description, that is, if 
it were to be a clinical technique for healing mental disease, had therefore to 
do something to reconcile the conscious will to its own erotic foundations—in 
short, to accept them instead of disowning them. But I have always wondered 
why Freud and his school have described the erotic processes of life with a 
curiously obscene nomenclature. Why call the erotic energy libido, suggesting 
“libidinous”? Why call the total distribution of erotic feeling over an infant’s 
body “polymorphous perversity”? What is the final effect of being able to speak 
of literary, artistic, and philosophical productions as manifestations of “anal 
eroticism”? It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is yet another symptom 
of disgust with oneself, and that Freud was at heart a moralist who, despite 
his brilliant diagnosis, did not like what he found and could not bring himself 
to that love of his own nature that would be the necessary condition for rec- 
onciling man to himself. 

There is another, though related, respect in which the Freudian philosophy 
stands in the way of letting psychoanalysis be an effective cure of man’s division 
against himself. This has been brought out and quite marvelously developed 
in a book that should certainly turn out to be one of the great philosophical 
works of our time, Professor Norman O. Brown’s (1959) Life against Death: The 


ETERNITY AS THE UNREPRESSED BODY 321 


Psychoanalytical Meaning of History. This is a sympathetic critique of the Freud- 
ian movement, written largely from a sociological standpoint, by a professor 
of classics at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, a man of obvi- 
ously considerable learning in many fields—philosophy, literature, economics, 
political science, and sociology. With humor, scholarship, and philosophical 
sophistication, Professor Brown proposes the outrageous thesis that Freud’s 
diagnosis be taken seriously, and that we actually face the practical possibility 
of doing without repression. It is his carefully argued opinion that civilization 
as we know it is an almost total denial of the human organism and its needs, a 
system of habitual and organized repression that is not biologically viable since 
it will destroy itself through pent-up hostility. He suggests that the lifting of 
repression will unveil many surprises: that exclusively genital sexuality is itself 
a repression, that death so far from something to be dreaded, is the foundation 
of individual personality, and that bodily existence is a form of bliss, which, 
if we would allow ourselves to experience it fully, would result in an almost 
mystical awareness of our union with the whole natural universe. 

Professor Brown begins by asking why Freud ended his life on a note of 
pessimism, and why, in effect, his final position was to take the side of the 
ego and the superego against the id. For if the function of psychoanalysis has 
to be to square the pleasure-principle of the libido with the reality-principle 
of civilization, to adjust erotic energy to practical human relations and their 
moral imperatives, surely it must fail as a means of healing the basic human 
sickness. If this is to be the final position of psychoanalysis, then, says Professor 
Brown, we need a psychoanalysis of psychoanalysis, which is what his book 
begins to provide. 

He traces Freud’s pessimism to his dual theory of the instincts, to the idea 
that in all living creatures there is a necessary and ingrained conflict between 
Eros and Thanatos, between the love of life and the wish to die. If this is so, 
says Professor Brown, “all organic life is then sick; we humans must abandon 
hope of cure.” He goes on, however, to reexamine Freud’s theory of the instincts, 
skillfully arguing that the pleasure-principle and the death-wish constitute not 
an irresolvable situation of conflict but a polarity or dialectical unity. He argues 
that the death-wish is not necessarily at variance with the pleasure-principle, 
for fear of death arises precisely from the repression of Eros, from living a life 
that at every present moment is so unsatisfactory that the only hope seems 
to lie in an indefinitely prolonged future in which we seek repeatedly for lost 
delights of a past infancy. 


The difference between men and animals is repression. Under condi- 
tions of repression, the repetition-compulsion establishes a fixation to 
the past, which alienates the neurotic from the present and commits 
him to the unconscious quest of the past in the future. (p. 92) 


322 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


The lifting of repression reveals that life, to which Eros presses, is life-and- 
death, and that death can be accepted when life has been fully lived, quoting 
Nietzsche’s, “What has become perfect, all that is ripe—wants to die.” “The 
precious ontological uniqueness which the human individual claims,” says 
Professor Brown, “is conferred on him not by possession of an immortal soul 
but by possession of a mortal body. ... At the simplest organic level, any 
particular animal or plant has uniqueness and individuality because it lives its 
own life and no other—that is to say, because it dies” (p. 104). Perhaps this is 
another way of saying that if an individual is unrecognizable without certain 
limits in space, it must also have limits in time, if time and space are actually 
inseparable. Freud’s dualism of the instincts, he says elsewhere, 


leads to a suicidal therapeutic pessimism, because it results in repre- 
senting conflict not as a human aberration but as a universal biological 
necessity; our modification of Freud’s ontology restores the possibility 
of salvation. It is the distinctive achievement of man to break apart 
the undifferentiated or dialectical unity of the instincts at the animal 
level. Man separates the opposites, turns them against each other, and, 
in Nietzsche’s phrase, sets life cutting into life. It is the privilege of 
man to revolt against nature and make himself sick. But if man has 
revolted from nature, it is possible for him to return to nature and 
heal himself. Then man’s sickness may be, again in Nietzsche’s phrase, 
a sickness in the sense that pregnancy is sickness, and it may end in 
a birth and a rebirth. (p. 84) 


The repression of Eros and its sublimation into the abstract and bodiless 
ends of human culture that are always somewhere off in the future, represent- 
ing an unconscious quest for the past, is thus what gives man a history. His 
concern with his history, personal or social, is the measure of his failure to 
be alive in the real present, becoming the fatuous pursuit of an ever-receding 
goal. Professor Brown quotes the economist J. M. Keynes’ Essays in Persuasion: 


Purposiveness means that we are more concerned with the remote 
future results of our actions than with their own quality or their 
immediate effects on our environment. The “purposive” man is always 
trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his acts by 
pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his 
cat, but his cat’s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kit- 
ten’s kittens, and so on forward for ever to the end of cat-dom. For 
him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam tomorrow and never 
jam today. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, 
he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality. [cited in 
Brown, 1959, p. 107] 


ETERNITY AS THE UNREPRESSED BODY 323 


The ending of repression, and thus the success of psychoanalysis, would 
therefore mean a recovery from history and a deliverance from spurious time. 
“Unrepressed life,’ Professor Brown says, “would be timeless or in eternity. 
Thus again psychoanalysis, carried to its logical conclusion and transformed 
into a theory of history, gathers to itself ageless religious aspirations . . . [It] 
comes to remind us that we are bodies, that repression is of the body, and 
that perfection would be the realm of Absolute Body; eternity is the mode of 
unrepressed bodies” (p. 93). 

Much of Professor Brown’s book is devoted to a discussion of what the 
life of the unrepressed body would be—something very different from the 
normal expectation of a life of unrestrained lust, hatred, and self-interest. His 
argument is that we should return (though why must he use this phrase?) to the 
“polymorphous perversity” of the infant, to a state in which the whole body is, 
as it were, an erogenous zone, resulting in a constant erotic communion with 
itself and the external world. He points out that though this may sound like 
the remotest utopian ideal, such a state of affairs has in fact occasionally been 
realized by mystics, both Western and Eastern, and may, indeed, descend out of 
the blue for brief periods upon very ordinary people—invariably carrying with 
it the conviction that this way of seeing things is reality, and that the so-called 
sober reality of the world as seen on Monday morning is a socially inculcated 
sham, based upon repressed senses. In such a state of open sensitivity, the most 
ordinary circumstances are so intensely marvelous that there is no conceiv- 
able necessity to go out seeking the enormous “kicks” of lust and violence. 
He argues, further, that if the Eros in us is indeed ultimately ineradicable, we 
have no choice but to be utopian, and to employ all our scientific resources, 
psychological and technological, in that direction. 


There is an attack on the great god Science in psychoanalysis; but 
the nature of the attack needs careful explanation. What is being 
probed, and found in some sense morbid, is not knowledge as such, 
but the unconscious schemata governing the pursuit of knowledge 
in modern civilization—specifically the aim of possession or mastery 
over objects (Freud), and the principle of economizing in the means 
(Ferenczi)... . In contrast, what would a nonmorbid science look 
like? It would presumably be erotic rather than (anal) sadistic in aim. 
Its aim would not be mastery over but union with nature. And its 
means would not be economizing but erotic exuberance. And finally, 
it would be based on the whole body and not just a part; that is to 
say, it would be based on the polymorphous perverse body. (p. 236) 


How is such a state of affairs to be brought about, and how are we to 
answer the obvious “practical” objections, let alone religiomoral objections, 
to the unrepressed life? It is here, I feel, that Professor Brown’s book leaves 


324 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


something to be desired; he does not really tackle these problems save, perhaps, 
to point out the enormous practical objections to continuing in the ways society 
believes to be realistic. Apparently Professor Brown has only slight faith in the 
psychoanalysis of couch and consulting room, seeing rightly enough that these 
problems are not to be solved by talking, and agreeing with Trigant Burrow 
in feeling that they are really social rather than individual. By this he does not 
appear to mean that the solution lies through such political measures as the 
abolition of capitalism or monogamy, but rather, I would gather, through the 
recognition that such social institutions as our concepts of time, the ego, money, 
success, status, personality-role, and even death, have only a conventional reality. 


Psychoanalysis . . . transformed into a science of culture would, of 
course, be able to dispense with its mysterious rites of individual initia- 
tion. The necessity, on which Freud insisted, of undergoing individual 
analysis in order to understand what psychoanalysis is talking about 
would be eliminated: the problem and the data would no longer be 
individual but social. I am not criticizing psychoanalytical therapy as 
a technique for restoring broken-down individuals to a useful role in 
society. (p. 155) 


There is a certain loss of insight reflected in the tendency of psycho- 
analysis to isolate the individual from culture. Once we recognize the 
limitations of talk from the couch, or rather, once we recognize that 
talk from the couch is still an activity in culture, it becomes plain 
that there is nothing for psychoanalysis to psychoanalyze except these 
(cultural) projections—the world of slums and telegrams and news- 
papers—and thus psychoanalysis fulfills itself only when it becomes 
historical and cultural analysis. (p. 170) 


So far so good, but surely Professor Brown does not mean historical and cultural 
analysis solely in the form of books and public discussions. 

At this point the author becomes vague, and this criticism seems to me well 
worth making because it is hard to believe that so cogent a thinker has not a 
great deal more to say about this aspect of the problem. It is almost impossible 
in a review to do justice to the complexity of the argument and the multiplicity 
of topics in this extraordinary book—the fascinating digressions into literature 
and economics, history and religion. All in all, the great contribution of this 
work is Professor Brown’s spirited and learned defense of the supreme reality 
and value of the organic human body and its physical environment. But one 
should not, I feel, jump to the conclusion that he is in any ordinary sense a 
mere materialist with a dreary mechanical-causal view of the physical world. 
He would certainly agree with Blake, whom he so often quotes, that “Energy is 
the only life, and is from the Body. . . . Energy is Eternal Delight.” And again, 


ETERNITY AS THE UNREPRESSED BODY 325 


“If we could cleanse the doors of perception, we should see everything as it 
is—infinite.” Indeed, as Professor Brown himself says, “The mentality which 
was able to reduce nature to ‘a dull affair, soundless, scentless, colorless; merely 
the hurrying of material endlessly, meaninglessly —Whitehead’s description—is 
lethal. It is an awe-inspiring attack on the life of the universe” (p. 316). 

If I may put this philosophy of trust in one’s own body and one’s own 
nature in my own words, I would say that if our senses could be sufficiently 
open, what we call the physical world, mortal and changing as it is, would give 
us all and perhaps more than we have ever asked of any spiritual world that 
we can possibly imagine. There have been times when, by various chances, my 
own senses have been opened far enough to see it, and to know that the process 
within us that Freud called libido is a love that comprises within itself at once 
everything from the earthiest sexuality, through the most human endearment, 
to Dante’s “love that moves the sun and other stars.” Perhaps the thing that 
is most deeply repressed in the Freudian system is that Eros is the same as 
Logos, that the supposedly blind and unconscious id is profoundly intelligent.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN 


Oriental and Occidental Approaches 
to the Nature of Man (1962) 


t is a common assumption among the most educated people in the 

Western world that the peoples of Asia are more primitive than we, 
and therefore represent within the scale of evolution a standpoint that for us 
would be regressive. It is furthermore understood that they do not in these 
cultures place much value upon individual personality and have ideas of man in 
which the individual tends to be merged in the collective, whether the collective 
be social or cosmic. It is understood that the ideal, say, of Indian spirituality is 
to enter into a state of consciousness in which the individual ego disappears 
into the undifferentiated esthetic continuum (courtesy of Dr. Northrup). 

Now this, of course, is a travesty, but historically it is rather interesting 
that this view of essential differences between East and West, a view to a large 
extent espoused by psychoanalysis, arose at just the time when the West was 
busy colonizing other peoples, particularly those in Asia. It thus became an 
extraordinarily convenient doctrine, for purpose of colonization, to suppose 
that this was not mere rapacity, but bringing the benefits of a higher order of 
civilization and culture to less developed peoples. 

Greater knowledge in the course of time shows us to what an enormous 
degree all these suppositions were unfounded and shows us furthermore that the 
typical contrasts that we believe to exist between East and West are to a large 
extent imaginary. Nevertheless, to make some of these contrasts is instructive 
just for theoretical discussion. I’m not, at the moment, going to point out by

detailed facts and illustrations how wrong these contrasts were, but to try to 
carry the discussion to a more constructive level. 

Now, I suppose it is true that the Western view, by which I mean largely 
the Anglo-Saxon-Protestant view of the nature of man, does set an enormous 
value upon integrity and the uniqueness of the individual. We have, of course, 
seen in this country a great epoch for so called rugged individualism, which 
has now collapsed. And, it is curious as one looks around even in such an 
intelligent assembly as this to notice an extraordinary uniformity of appear- 
ance. In other words, what individualism led to was an increasing conformity 
and loss of individuality, because when the value of each individual finger is 
so emphasized that it amounts to the severance of the finger from the hand, 
the finger begins to lose its life. 

I believe we are seeing the consequence of this individualism by the fact 
that it is swinging over into its opposite—that is to say into simple collectiv- 
ism—because actually the individualist and the collectivist doctrine, the capitalist 
doctrine and the Marxist doctrine, rest upon the same misconception of man’s 
nature: the conception of man as something that is not truly natural. That may 
sound odd because the flavor of scientific thought in the nineteenth century, 
from which Marxism and Capitalism and, of course, much of psychotherapeu- 
tic doctrine emerges, was a philosophy of scientific naturalism or monism. It 
was felt that the human psyche was a naturalistic phenomenon and not a soul 
imprisoned in flesh from another world. But the behavior of Western man has 
belied this theory altogether. For it is out of a climate of scientifically natu- 
ralistic opinion that there arose a technology whose avowed aims were “the 
conquest of nature” and an attack of major dimensions on the physical world. 

For the feeling was no longer that man was a supernatural soul embodied 
but that he was a natural freak—an accident of nature—a completely sponta- 
neous and unreliable emergence of intelligence resulting from the process of 
natural selection that could not be relied upon to perpetuate the phenomenon. 
Therefore, man as the intelligent accident had to seize the initiative and defend 
his intelligence and his culture against all forces of natural erosion. Thus, the 
natural freak took the place of the supernatural creation, but the two doctrines 
are in practice identical. 

Now we contrast this, though the contrast is a flagrant generalization, with 
such conceptions of man as we find especially in China, in the doctrine known 
as “Taoism,” and to some extent in India, in conceptions of man that are found 
in Buddhism and Hinduism. Here we find, I think, something of enormous 
importance. It is generally understood that the view of man’s identity among 
Buddhists and Taoists is based on some terrifying regressive experience called 
“mysticism” or the “oceanic feeling,” and I think much misunderstanding arises 
from the use of such words. Generally speaking, the content of this sort of 
experience is that the boundaries that are ordinarily established between the ego, 
or the individual, and the rest of the world are not rigid boundaries at all and 


ORIENTAL AND OCCIDENTAL APPROACHES 329 


that they are not boundaries in the sense of being walls but rather boundaries 
in the sense of being bridges. In other words, in these types of thought the 
human being inside the skin and the world outside the skin are regarded as 
having in the skin a common boundary that belongs to both. We know this in 
our own behavioral sciences, especially in human ecology and social psychol- 
ogy. We know very well that if we try to describe accurately the behavior of 
the human organism, whether that behavior be called psychic or physical, we 
have only to go a few steps before it becomes necessary for us to describe the 
behavior of the environment—and vice versa. In other words, you can’t go very 
far in talking about the behavior of an individual person, or of a social group, 
or of a species, without talking about the behavior of the environment: thus 
you are beginning to describe the behavior of a unified field. 

Although, in these sciences, it is perfectly clear theoretically that this is 
what we are talking about, there is no parallel as yet between this theoretical 
conception of man and our personal feeling of our own identity. We still feel 
ourselves to be what I have called skin-encapsulated egos, and whatever value 
this feeling may have, carried too far it leads to a chronic alienation, a sense 
of loneliness, of being isolated intelligent organisms in a blind, unintelligent 
universe. This drives us to seek security in a herd-like social structure. There- 
fore, there are two views of man that are not contradictory, but that should 
stand to each other in a hierarchical order. (1) The Eastern view of man as 
a node in a unified field of behavior, because, after all, this so called mystical 
experience is nothing other than a direct sensation of man-and-the-universe 
as a single pattern of behavior. That’s all it is. You don’t need to invoke any 
spooky business whatsoever. (2) The Western view, which stresses the special 
value of each organism and its unique character. 

These two views of man go together in a hierarchical pattern. They are 
not mutually exclusive. I have sometimes said that it is characteristic of maturity 
to be able to distinguish what is more important from what is less important, 
without making what is less important unimportant. I feel that it is quite basic 
that we need a conception of man coupled with a sensation of man as really 
belonging in his natural and cosmic environment. We cannot assume that we 
are unique islands of intelligence in a completely capricious world. For a world 
in which man evolves must be an environment itself evolved to the point where 
it can ecologically sustain the human organism. An intelligent organism argues 
an intelligent environment. 

It is of capital importance for the Western world to find some means 
of sensing ourselves in this way unless we are to run amuck completely and 
abuse and exploit our natural resources and animal, insect, and bacteriological 
fellow-beings. We shall never use this world correctly without the concrete 
definite experience that it is as much our own body as what is inside our skin. 
But this universal feeling of man’s nature is not antithetical to Western values 
concerning the importance of the individual and its personality. As a matter

of fact, not only is there no conflict between them but they are mutually 
essential. To return to the finger: the fingers of the hand can move separately. 
They are plainly articulated and quite different, but their life, their difference, 
their individuality, depends upon their belonging to one organism—to having 
beneath their individual difference a common ground. 

These Eastern views of man have emphasized our common ground, 
what in Hindu philosophy is called the Atman, the super-individual self that is 
always underlying our individual selves. To go back down into that ground is 
not a regression. It is recovering again the foundation of one’s house. To use 
the French phrase, it is reculer pour mieux sauter—going back to take a better 
jump. Childhood and the maternal basis of nature is not something that we 
leave and quit in becoming adult. It is something from which we grow up as 
a tree grows up from the soil. 


CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT 


The Woman in Man (1963) 


f I am asked, “What is a woman?” I must reply, “I know, but when 

you ask me, I don’t.” As soon as we become analytical and definite 
about things, familiar objects tend to disappear. Under the microscope, human 
flesh seems to disintegrate into an unfamiliar arabesque of cells. This is why 
scientific investigation seems so often to be a debunking of popularly held 
notions, for when we examine things closely and carefully, we realize that the 
world is a lot less easily categorizable than we might imagine. 

Attention has been drawn to the unsoundness of hard and fast distinctions 
between male and female, masculine and feminine, based upon a bifurcation 
of the innate and the acquired. In the past the physiologist and biologist were 
expected to tell us what a woman really is; that is to say, how she was made 
by nature. Then came the anthropologist and the historian, and later the psy- 
chologist and psychoanalyst, to tell us how she has been distorted by culture, 
as if there were some fundamental difference between what man is biologically 
and physically, and what he becomes through cultural or self-conditioning. This 
would argue a basic distinction between nature and culture, between natural 
and artificial, and between the biological and animal on the one hand, and the 
human on the other. I think that this is a distinction from which our culture 
is actually suffering, and one to be made only with great care, realizing that it 
is entirely for purposes of discussion. 

We make distinctions between things in order to be able to talk about 
them. The human body is, after all, a unity; it goes continuously all the way

from top to bottom. It has some interesting parts in it, and if I want to talk 
about those, I describe it in the digital system of language; I have to cut the 
body into bits. I have to say it has a head, a neck, and shoulders, and speak 
about these things almost as though they were parts of a machine, which as a 
matter of fact they are not. This is because we have to cut things up in order 
to digest them, in the same way that you get a cutup fryer in the store but 
you don’t get cutup fryers ready chopped out of eggs. 

The differences, then, between what is masculine and what is feminine must 
be thought of from many points of view. There are things that are typically 
masculine and typically feminine, using the word “typically” in a very strict 
and special sense, since things that are typically masculine or typically feminine 
have no necessary connection with biologically identifiable males or females. 

For example, in psychoanalytic symbolism all long things are male and all 
round things are female. Aggressiveness is typically male; passivity is typically 
female. But we are only speaking here in a kind of symbolism that is highly 
useful, so long as we don’t confuse it with actual individuals, and what they are 
supposed to be and how they are supposed to behave. I want, then, to draw 
attention to a strong tendency in the Anglo-Saxon subculture of the United 
States to identify all value with certain stereotypes of the male and to put 
down and devaluate certain stereotypes of the female. This is quite a different 
matter from exalting men and debasing women. 

I want to talk about things, attitudes, and ways of thinking that are typi- 
cally male or female rather than biologically male or female. 

It seems that the human mind, whatever that is—I would prefer perhaps 
to say the human organism—is equipped with two modes of sensitivity, which 
I will compare respectively to the spotlight and the floodlight or to something 
like central and peripheral vision in the eye. According to our system of typical 
symbols, the spotlight, being a pinpoint sort of thing, will be male, and the 
floodlight, being diffused, will be female. This is interesting, since our culture 
puts these two kinds of knowing in a hierarchy of values whereby the spotlight 
is considered much more important than the floodlight. 

To be specific, the spotlight mode of consciousness is what we call con- 
scious attention. It is the kind of attention that we use when we read or when 
we notice things. For example, a husband can come home from a committee 
meeting and his wife will say, “Well, what was Mrs. Smith wearing?” And he 
will say, “I didn’t notice,” even though she happened to be sitting right opposite 
him at the conference table. He indeed saw, his eyes registered optically what 
the dress was, and what its color was, but it was not noticed. 

All knowledge upon which science is based, and upon which the careful 
description, study, and organization of the world is based, depends on noticing, 
or “spotlight knowledge,” and it is characteristic of this that it focuses on certain 
areas of experience. To the degree that it illuminates those areas brightly and 
comprehends them, it ignores what lies outside. 


THE WOMAN IN MAN 333 


Conversely, there is the method of knowing like the floodlight. This is a 
way of understanding that does not notice but somehow manages to take in 
a whole variety of things simultaneously. In other words, you can drive your 
car into town without even thinking about it, using that kind of knowledge. 
You regulate your breathing, the secretions of your glands, the circulation of 
your blood, and all the homeostatic balances of the organism by this kind of 
diffused sensitivity. It is a curious thing that there is really no scientific name for 
this mode of knowing. It has been called the preconscious, the subconscious, 
the unconscious, the superconscious, but these are all very vague terms, lack- 
ing in precision. Yet there is quite definitely underneath the spotlight kind of 
attention this diffused knowledge, or awareness of all that is going on, without 
which we should be completely and totally lost. 

However, in a culture that underestimates the value of this mode of 
knowledge, the academic world does almost nothing to develop it. Lynn Whyte 
pointed out some years ago that the academic world values only three kinds 
of intelligence: mnemonic intelligence, that is, good memory; computational 
intelligence, being able to figure; and verbal intelligence, being able to read and 
write. It does not, he said, develop social intelligence or kinesthetic intelligence. 

Social intelligence is something that is exceedingly difficult to teach by 
any system of verbal instruction; you have to get it by osmosis. But the 
scientific temper as we have known it undervalues that sort of knowledge, 
because of its vagueness and uncontrollability. Therefore, we tend instead to 
value conceptual knowledge, and through that we get a wholly conceptual 
orientation toward life. 

I would like to discuss what seem to me to be four principle symptoms 
of this one-sided orientation. Firstly, there is a tendency for symbols to be 
valued more highly than what they represent. For example, money becomes 
much more important than wealth. In other words, the symbol, or notation, 
for goods becomes more valuable than the goods themselves, and the reporting 
of things that happen becomes more valuable than the events themselves. It is 
a byword in the academic world today that how you are recorded in the reg- 
istrar’s office is much more important than anything you did by way of study, 
because it is your record that counts. If you present yourself in a government 
office and say, “Here I am,” they say you do not exist unless you produce a 
piece of paper such as a birth certificate to prove that you do exist, and in the 
same way a lot of people don’t feel that they are really alive unless they can 
read about it in the newspaper. 

I believe that this is the basis of a great deal of juvenile delinquency. 
Because you can read all about it, you can be a hero and see that you really 
do exist, because the record of history has put you down as being really here. 
So in this sense, we come to what somebody has recently called pseudo-events: 
the arrangement of meetings, of parties, of all sorts of affairs simply for the 
purpose of being written about in the newspapers or shown on television. 


334 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


I am not quite sure this symposium is a pseudo-event at the moment or 
not, but I want to point out that the style of evaluating things so that what 
is on the label is more important than what is in the bottle, that the skinny 
cover of one’s automobile is more important than what is under the hood—that 
whole feeling of the symbol having primacy over the what the symbol signi- 
fies—is the result of giving an excessive valuation to noticing. In this way it is 
characteristic of our culture that when you get a menu in a restaurant it is far 
more interesting to read it than actually to eat what it stands for. This is the 
difference between our menus and other people’s: a French menu just gives the 
bare name of the dish. But here we go on to say “garnished with crispy toasted 
slivers of fresh farmhouse potatoes’—a long, long mouthwatering description 
of something that may well turn up uncooked in rancid axle grease. 

Secondly, we tend to notice things and ignore their contexts or backgrounds. 
Often with a group I draw a circle on the blackboard and ask, “What have I 
drawn?” In the vast majority of cases people will say I have drawn a circle or a 
ball or something like that; very few will ever suggest that I have drawn a wall 
with a hole in it, because again we tend to notice a small figure enclosed and 
to ignore the background. While this gives us enormous power of description, 
it also is a serious disadvantage for human survival in that it makes us blind to 
the environmental factors of all things and events. We regard what is inside the 
boundary of one’s skin as being much more important than what is outside. 
This is a familiar problem to architects, because they know that most of their 
clients think of a house in terms of a person rattling around in a space. But 
the architect sees the space and the person as an integrated unit and therefore 
does something more than just provide him with a cubic box to rattle around 
in; he wants the house related to all that that particular person does within the 
house, because he sees the house and the person as one activity, a single process. 

When human beings do not notice this, and regard the earth that surrounds 
them, the hills, the forests, the vegetables, the birds, and the waters as a kind 
of grocery store where you simply expect things to be on the shelves to be 
exploited and plundered, they become unaware of the solid fact that the earth 
around them is an integral part of their own body. It is just as much you as 
your hands and your feet, and as soon as you neglect that, you begin to get 
deteriorated products in the soil, you begin to get problems of water shortage, 
air pollution, imbalances of insect life, epidemics, and God knows only what. 
This comes as an exaggeration of this typically masculine way of thinking, 
which notices the figure and ignores the ground. 

The third thing is rather intimately related to that—a conception of the 
human personality as something inhabiting the body, so that each one of us 
senses himself as a center of consciousness in a bag of skin, confronting an 
alien world of more or less stupid mechanisms. The primitive science of the 
nineteenth century has become twentieth-century common sense, and thus it 
seems generally plausible that value, love, and intelligence exist only within 


THE WOMAN IN MAN 335 


man, within the human organism, and that therefore outside in the world of 
nature there is an impersonal, mechanical process that has absolutely nothing 
in common with human values. That estrangement is again a result of noticing 
only one-half of one’s own existence, to notice the half inside the skin and 
ignore the “better-half” outside. 

A fourth way in which this kind of valuation appears in our culture, is that 
the male tends to become mistrustful of all within him that is feminine, and 
tends therefore to insist on his masculinity in extremely exaggerated ways and 
to identify with stereotypes of what it is to be a man, which are quite absurd. 

You will notice in current magazines an advertisement sponsored by the 
United States Marine Corps. It shows enormous phallic rockets standing at 
Cape Canaveral and a boy in a helmet talking anxiously on the telephone, and 
the caption says, “What does it take to feel like a man?” Now I don’t want 
to discourage the Marine Corps, but that is not the way to go about it; you 
won't get real men in the Marine Corps that way. If you want to get real men 
to join the Marine Corps, there is a very simple formula—I leave it to your 
imagination. But phallic rockets are going to attract a man who is afraid that 
he is not a male and therefore compensates by identifying himself with exagger- 
ated male stereotypes. As a result of this we get the general feeling that there 
is something weak about feminine characteristics and the fear that it would be 
“sissy” for a man to incorporate within his personality elements of grace and 
charm. To be uncharming, to be gruff, grubby, and tough has been considered 
the quintessence of maleness. 

I was recently reading an anecdote about that great pirate and admiral, 
Sir Francis Drake, entertaining a Spanish nobleman for dinner aboard ship. He 
had actually captured the Spanish nobleman and was negotiating for fat ran- 
som, but he did it in a gentlemanly way. Here was this tough old sea captain 
entertaining at dinner, dressed in lavish silks, with gold plate on the table and a 
trio with violins and flutes. As a parting gift Sir Francis presented the Spaniard 
with several bottles of fine perfume. Imagine being entertained in such style 
aboard a United States aircraft carrier. 

The person who has no reason to doubt his masculine potency can really 
afford feminine graciousness, but in this culture he may be thought homosexual 
or sissy because he does so. But this exaggerated worship of the male gives 
itself away. 

These are four symptoms that show, in various ways, how something that 
we might call feminine in the typical sense is neglected, undeveloped, unused. 

Let me repeat them: Firstly, the symbol has more value than the thing, 
and Logos more value than Eros. 

Secondly, the seed is valued more than the soil and the word more valued 
than context. 

Thirdly, the individual is more valued than the individual’s own extended 
body, which is his whole natural environment. 


336 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


Fourthly, a special form of the symbol being more important than the fact, 
the symbols of maleness are confused with genuine maleness. 

It is an ancient tradition that man is completed only by developing the 
feminine within himself. This underlies such forms of oriental self-development— 
Tantra in India and Taoism in China. Lao-tse, great philosopher of Taoism, in 
his classic, the Tao Te Ching, the book of the way and its power, says, “While 
being a male one should cleave to the female, and so doing one will become 
a universal channel and be possessed of a power that one will never call upon 
in vain.” Taoism is the whole art of completing the masculine by the feminine. 
He says elsewhere, “Man at his birth is supple and tender, but in death he is 
rigid and hard. Therefore suppleness and tenderness are the marks of life, but 
rigidity and hardness are the marks of death.” This is illustrated by the parable 
of the willow and the pine. Under the weight of snow the springy branches 
of the willow give way and the snow falls off them, but the pine stands there 
with tough strong branches, and as the weight of the snow increases they 
finally crack. Every engineer knows in building a bridge that it must sway in 
the wind and be flexible; a rigid bridge is a collapsed bridge. This is equally 
true of psychological and cultural rigidity, and thus symbolic overmaleness is 
profoundly weak and unsound. 

It is not, then, without reason that in old theological writings the soul is 
always “she,” the anima, the ewig Weiblichkeit, the muse, the feminine source 
of inspiration. You don’t hear much about that today because souls are out of 
fashion. We think of the soul as some kind of anthropoid or maybe gynecoid 
spook, whereas the soul is precisely what I called our generalized sensitivity, our 
floodlight awareness, as distinct from our spotlight awareness. It is our innate, 
natural intelligence, completely structured like our bodies, which are at root a 
form of thinking, of unbelievably subtle intelligence. The academic fallacy is 
that what cannot be described in words is neither intelligent nor intelligible. Yet 
the neurologist is unable to figure out the complexity of the very brain with 
which he thinks, and such a man tends to become humble through realizing 
that he is more intelligent than he knows! He is more intelligent than he can 
explain himself as being, in flat contradiction to the erstwhile scientific fashion of 
considering rational intelligence more intelligent than subconscious intelligence. 

To value and use this hidden feminine aspect is peculiarly important in the 
problem of bringing about constructive change in human behavior. If history 
has one monotonous lesson, it is this: that human behavior has never been 
changed by preaching. Violence, whether physical or moral, does not truly 
move the human being. Even so great an apostle of nonviolence as Gandhi 
was still a violent man, because his appeal was a serious and earnest call to 
duty. Why is it that nobody has yet tried to change human behavior by the 
force of enchantment? Would you, as a woman, get very far by saying to some 
man, “It is your duty to raise children and bring up a family; you must love 
me! Come on now, get to work!” 


THE WOMAN IN MAN 337 


You go about it in an entirely different way, on the principle that you catch 
flies with honey. In the same way, educators, ministers, legislators, or whoever 
is interested in changing human conduct must realize that they need to go to 
charm school and to be like the musician Orpheus, who was supposed to tame 
the wild beasts and calm the winds by playing on his lyre. He is the archetypal 
symbol of the man who developed his feminine aspect and became a universal 
enchanter, commanding the obedience of the world because it just loved to 
follow. That is the secret power of the feminine. I don’t think I am “giving the 
show away” about the secret of feminine power. Nor am I trying to advocate a 
greater respect for, and use of, this power by warnings of doom—that we are 
going to be annihilated by atomic bombs, overpopulation, and ecologic imbal- 
ances if we don’t pay attention to this principle. The point is rather that it is a 
way of living that is a delight, not a duty. For it will never be worth surviving 
if we must survive, but only if continuing to live is an expression of joy. 


CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE 


An Interview with Alan Watts (1969) 


(with Philip D. Ungerer) 


NGERER: What sorts of things are you thinking about now in 
| Dpeeet to the days of The Spirit of Zen? 

Watts: Well, I’m fundamentally interested today in the problems of human 
ecology, the double situation of our technological development on the one 
hand and our sense of human identity on the other. Because our technology 
in the hands of a man or being who feels alienated from his environment is 
an extremely dangerous thing. We are actively fouling our own nests at the 
moment, using technology to destroy and pollute the planet. I feel the reason 
we are doing that is because we have a hallucinatory sense of identity. Man 
experiencing himself as a skin-encapsulated ego is a completely false feeling. 
It’s against the facts of biology and ecology. I’m interested in talking in that 
sort of language because the scientific and academic community, as well as the 
political one, cannot understand the language of mysticism. 

Uncerer: Are you saying that this is the first time that man cannot identify 
the problem? He knows the symbols. 

Watts: Yes. His problems have become all too real. Therefore, you get to 
the point where the man who regards himself as extremely hard-nosed and 
practical is forced by the logic of his condition to face up to the mystical. 

Uncerer: How is it more real today than, say, the things that confronted 
the individual in the Middle Ages? 

Watts: Simply because technology has amplified everything we do. It’s like 
turning up the volume on the radio. So, the things we think we want and our 
strategy for getting them—here’s a situation which, in other words, has simply

been turned up. So we see it so devastatingly clearly that it simply cannot be 
dodged. There’s no escape anymore. You can’t get away from civilization any- 
more. There are no far-off frontiers. People think about getting out into space, 
but more and more one sees there is no escape. So you have to turn around 
and face the fundamental questions: Who am I and what do I want? Everyone 
has to face this because there is nowhere else to go. 

Uncerer: What sorts of things are you examining within this context? 

Warts: A number of things. The philosophy of war, for example. That’s 
a nitty-gritty question. 

Uncerer: What can we do to further our self-knowledge on some of 
these things? 

Warts: It’s a matter of consistently thinking through your feelings. In other 
words, I was asked by the Air Force weapons research center in New Mexico 
a few years ago to be on a panel to discuss the question of what is your basis 
for personal morality. This was started by the chaplains because none of the 
senior officers indicated any religious preference. Apparently, this disturbed the 
chaplains. So they thought they'd better expose these senior officers to some 
sort of religious thinking. They had an Episcopalian, Jesuit, etc. I said to these 
people that my basis for personal morality, and I'll tell you quite frankly because 
you people are supposed to be realistic people, my basis is that I am out for 
me. But I’m not going to be crude about it. I’m not going to trouble people. 
I’m going to make a pretense that I’m very nice and I’m all for them and that 
I love everybody and I’m ready to cooperate. But, I told them, I have a couple 
of problems. The two problems are, first of all, what do I want? The more I 
think about it, the more I realize that I don’t know. There are two situations 
in which you don’t know what you want. The first is one in which you really 
haven't thought about it at all. You think you want the things that Madison 
Avenue tells you you ought to want. The second situation is where you’ve been 
through all that. You’ve thought out what other things go with all the things 
you say you want and then you realize you cannot relate yourself to the world 
in the position of saying I want certain things out of this world because there 
are no things in this world. There are no separate things. Everything goes 
with everything else. Then you ask the question, you love yourself, you say, 
but who are you? And you find that you cannot ever find a separate definable 
entity that can be called you. 

Uncerer: You are with the world? 

Warts: You are with it. You're a symptom of the world. Fundamentally, 
you are the universe, as the universe is centered at a particular place one calls 
here and now. The universe centers itself at every center. It’s like on the surface 
of a sphere, every point on the surface can be regarded as the center of that 
surface. In the same way, the universe is an energy system centered wherever 
there is a center. The human organism is a center. So you discover that your 
whole notion of yourself as an ego inhabiting a bag of skin is an illusion or 


AN INTERVIEW WITH ALAN WATTS 341 


a social institution actually of a high civilization which has defined people in 
that way. People are hoaxed into believing that a social institution is a physi- 
cal reality. So we get this situation of people actually feeling themselves in a 
sensory way of being this ego inside the bag of skin. They do not realize that 
this is simply brain washing imposed upon them in childhood. 

UncEeRER: Given this state of affairs, what can man do about it? 

Watts: The question is the trouble. Because what can I do about it sim- 
ply aggravates the situation of thinking in terms of a separate ego. So we've 
got a situation today when everybody feels powerless. We feel that things are 
out of control, that civilization is much too complicated, that nobody under- 
stands it. That even the President of the United States doesn’t know what he’s 
doing—and indeed he doesn’t. But the meaning of that situation is that we 
feel out of control because the individual we think ourselves to be is unreal. 
Of course you can’t control everything as an ego because you don’t exist as an 
ego. You exist as the total organism-environment-energy field that’s you. We've 
got models of the world that are hopelessly out of date. The Christian-Jewish 
model of the world is political. It’s the king. The God-King who is in charge of 
everything and rules it by spiritual violence. And that’s a totally obsolete model 
in a universe which is organic or at least quantum mechanics as distinguished 
from Newton’s mechanics. That’s why we are feeling our powerlessness. So 
to ask the question “what can we do about it?” is to ask the wrong question. 

Uncerer: I remember one time you talking about the cork in the water. 
Isn’t what you’re saying now quite different from that? 

Warts: Yes. If you think of yourself as a cork in the water, that implies 
that you are completely passive, that you are a victim of circumstances and 
are moved around by your environment like a puppet. But that’s simply the 
other pole of the idea that you are separate from your environment and that 
you should dominate it. Both are based on the same false premise that you are 
separate from your environment. You’re only a puppet so long as you define 
yourself that way. But when you realize that what you are truly is that you 
are your whole physical organism, and that includes your brain and nervous 
system and all the rest—And the human brain is far more intelligent than any 
human ego because it is an organized system which we cannot yet describe in 
language yet—it is far too complicated. 

Uncerer: How so the ego? 

Watts: The ego is merely a social institution. It’s a way of defining the 
mask, what role you play. But the brain, which is in a way what you are to begin 
with, organically, has as yet escaped full description. And because, therefore, it 
has a higher order of complexity than the most complex language we can use 
to describe it, it is more intelligent. So what we've got to do, as we say, is use 
your head. And that doesn’t mean think. It means use your nervous system, 
which is to say we have to relearn being spontaneous. A person only thinks 
when he doesn’t trust himself. 


342 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


Uncerer: You've said, though, that when one is confronted by the command 
“Be You,” one finds it impossible. I see a departure in what you're saying now. 

Warts: Yes, but the danger is with people who think they are going to be 
spontaneous, that they imitate their preconception of spontaneous behavior. We 
think that our culture is defined as nonspontaneous so we think spontaneous 
behavior must be the opposite of the way we normally behave. When you get 
an encounter group, for example, people say they are going to take off their 
social masks. Immediately, they start being hostile to each other because they 
think that’s more real. It isn’t necessarily. We see it only as too alternatives. We 
have to learn a new dimension: What do you really feel like? And to do that 
you have to stop categorizing, stop thinking. You have to be quiet. You have 
to look for you, whatever that is. It’s possible. 

UNGERER: We're trapped in words here, obviously. 

Watts: Of course, but the point is that we are completely spontaneous in 
growing hair, breathing, all that’s going on all the time. It’s highly intelligent, 
but it’s unpremeditated. 

Uncerer: We really are there already? 

Watts: Yes, it’s a question of realization. 

Uncerer: What, by the way, do you think of the approaches in psychiatry 
today? 

Warts: The whole domain of psychiatry is very exciting because in some 
ways it’s sharply divided between custodial psychiatry and adventurous psy- 
chiatry. Custodial psychiatry is a terrifying priesthood which is perpetrating in 
contemporary terms everything that was done by the Spanish Inquisition. In 
1600, a person who had deviant religious opinions was considered an excep- 
tionally dangerous person. Because he would, as a result of his unbelief, be 
damned eternally. And the people who said that had the same kind of authority 
in their culture as the professor of pathology at the University of Chicago. So 
if the professor of pathology says somebody has cancer there’s no question 
about it. He has cancer. If, in 1600, the professor of theology said someone 
had heresy, it too was a serious problem. And they were asking out of a sense 
of mercy; that this person had to be cured because he is going to suffer for 
all eternity. And anybody he infects is likewise going to suffer. So we are first 
going to reason with him and if he won't listen to reason, we are going to put 
pressure on him and finally, we are going to burn him. Because just at the last 
moment, that might get a repentance out of him. These people were acting 
in a fully responsible sense that they were after mental health for the good of 
everybody. Today, religion is not important. In a sense, all religion is phony. 
People really don’t believe in it, but they think they ought to. The moment you 
get sermons on the subject of how one ought to have faith, religion is dead. 
Because the assumptions of religion have not become unquestioned common 
sense. So what has taken the place of heresy is not deviant opinion about 
religion, but a deviant state of consciousness. So a schizophrenic is a heretic 


AN INTERVIEW WITH ALAN WATTS 343 


because he is experiencing the world in an irregular way. So we can’t stand it. 
When we get this behavior, we say that fellow is all mixed up because he doesn’t 
go along with our feeling of what isn’t mixed up, what is straight conduct. So 
we put them in an institution where they are depersonalized. They become 
nonpeople. And then everything done to these people in the institution helps 
to confirm that. In order to get attention, he has to become violent. But that 
defines him as sick. So the whole thing is a vicious circle. They subject these 
people to torture—shock treatment, deprivation of all civil rights. You have the 
inquisition all over again. 

Uncerer: And the adventuresome kind? 

Warts: A great many people in psychotherapy realize that’s not the answer. 
They may quarrel with the whole model of mental illness as being an illness at 
all. The work of a psychiatrist, many of these people think, is not to cure sick 
people, but to cure normal people. Get rid of the normal hallucinations that 
are fouling up the whole of human society. You can call a number in Chicago, 
for example. It’s called “Let Freedom Ring.” You get a taped spiel against sen- 
sitivity training, encounter groups, all these things, equating them to Chinese 
Communist techniques of self-criticism, where everybody gets themselves into 
a group and reduces themselves to a common denominator. These Bircher 
people haven't the faintest idea of the difference of that on the one hand and 
on the other hand a group that has nothing to do with self-criticism at all. It’s 
self-realization. You can only have self-criticism in relation to some preconceived 
standard of how you ought to be. Here, a truly operating encounter group 
is one where you don’t know where you are going. No preconceived idea of 
what you ought to be. 

Uncerer: Do you find this perhaps the most hopeful technique? 

Watts: That’s rather the wrong question, again. The only truly hopeful thing 
for the future is people who know how to live in the present. The schizophrenic 
is somebody who feels that there is something wrong, but doesn’t know what 
it is. Beyond schizophrenia is the same sort of person who is enlightened, like 
a Buddha, and he knows what’s the matter, he knows how to negotiate with 
society. The schizophrenic doesn’t know how to negotiate with society because 
he cannot live both on his level of consciousness and pretend to live on the 
level of consciousness of ordinary people. 

Uncerer: In a sense they are both wearing masks. 

Watts: Sure, but in the latter case you've got a conscious mask instead of 
an unconscious one. You know what you're doing. I said earlier that the only 
people who have a hopeful future are those who can live in the present. Because 
plans are only useful to people who know how to live in the present. Because 
if your plans materialize, that materializing of those plans can be useful only if 
you can enjoy them. If, when plans mature, you always are making other plans, 
you never get there. So now, we should realize there is no place to be except the 
present. It’s even nonsense to talk about exercises to live in the present because 


344 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


you can’t do anything else. So we have to see that’s the situation. In the same 
way it’s not a question of how do I overcome my egocentricity. You are not 
an ego in a real sense. So it’s a matter of simply seeing what is already is the 
case. So, in this sense, everything I’m trying to do is not to be understood in 
the context of preaching. Of saying you should. I’m only interested in what’s 
happening. If one can show to people in government, in terms of, say, military 
strategy, that what is happening is in flat contradiction to what they say they 
want, we say to them you are not immoral, you are simply stupid. Because you 
don’t know what you want and what you think you want you aren't getting. 
Take the war in Viet Nam. It would be a perfectly understandable war if we 
were over there to capture the territory and carry off all those beautiful girls 
and bring them back to the United States and screw them. Because if that were 
our intention, it would be perfectly understandable, human and merciful, for 
we'd be careful to preserve the territory and keep the girls in good shape. As 
it is, we are fighting for a pure abstraction. We are fighting an ideology called 
Communism in the name of another ideology called Free Enterprise, neither 
of which actually exist in reality. But because we are fighting for an ideology, 
not anything real, we are absolutely ruthless. There can be no agreement, no 
compromise because we are just as hung up on our ideology as they are on 
theirs. Until we get away from these ideologies and go back to being ordinary, 
scurrilous human beings, we'll never understand each other. 

Uncerer: I'd like to get you back to therapy for a moment. Could you 
elaborate a bit on your feelings about the encounter approach? 

Watts: I think on the whole this sort is better than the couch approach, the 
psychoanalysis ritual because it’s focused on the here and now. Psychoanalysis 
has always considered that what you are today is the result of your past and, 
therefore, you have to go back into the past. That’s like saying the wake drives 
the ship. What I think is developing, and what I think many therapists under- 
stand today, is that you’re not the consequence of an abstract past, but that 
right now you are creating your problems. Therefore, let’s watch the problem 
in the act of being created. 

Uncerer: And the use of drugs? 

Watts: I think this is not a new situation because drugs have been used 
for centuries because, after all, we are what we eat. When we find what we 
are is somehow not right, we eat a little something to adjust our feelings. So 
we take medicine when we get sick and all drugs are medicine rather than 
diet because they are correctives. So we have to beware of living on drugs as 
diet. The drugs like LSD, etc. are correctives. You don’t need to take LSD very 
often. Two or three times in a lifetime may be quite adequate. That can give a 
person a completely different perspective about who he is and what’s going on. 
That should be enough. Once you get the message, you hang up the phone. It 
can be very helpful, but not just by itself. LSD is not bottled wisdom. We've 
found that what it does to them is proportional to what they bring to it. If 
you give LSD to a very creative person, it helps him be more than he already 


AN INTERVIEW WITH ALAN WATTS 345 


is. But if you give it to someone who is basically an adolescent, he doesn’t get 
much out of it. I know a lot of kids who are saying they are through with 
the drug scene because there was nothing in it. Well, the point is, there wasn’t 
enough in them. If you do know how to use it, LSD can be as valuable to an 
investigator of the mind as a microscope is to a biochemist. 

UncerER: What do you consider to be the most insidious things being 
done in psychiatry today? 

Watts: Things like lobotomies, shock treatments. All those things that 
are done to normalize people forcibly. It doesn’t work. It’s a frantic passion to 
maintain reality in the form of the world as seen on a bleak Monday morning. 
It’s a matter of not having any expectations. You see, that’s the whole problem 
of education today. The university thinks they know what the future is for 
which they should prepare these children. The truth of the matter is the world 
is changing so rapidly, we don’t know what the future is. So the function of 
an educational institution is to put young people into a situation where they 
learn how to face the unknown or unpredictable. That means that everybody 
in the university, faculty, that is, or students, are all students engaged in a coop- 
erative opening of our minds to not what we know but what we don’t know. 
Everybody’s engaged in research. You ask questions. The Socratic method is 
the model. The highest compliment, by the way, that you can pay to a scholar’s 
book is not that he has the answers, but that he asks the right questions. 

Uncerer: Do reviewers say that about your books? 

Warts: I don’t very often get reviewed. I don’t know why. Whenever, for 
example, I’ve written books that start from a theological basis, you see what I 
do in my books is go around a wheel and approaching the hub along different 
spokes. The spokes can be theology, logical positivism, psychiatric assump- 
tions, it makes no difference where I start, but because I’m headed for that 
hub which is the point about man’s identity that he is not this separate thing, 
but that he is the whole universe. Now, when I write a theological book, the 
theologians never will review it except that they'll misrepresent it entirely and 
then argue against that misrepresentation. Niebuhr did this with one of my 
books years ago. He simply stated that the case presented by the book was 
the exact opposite of the case that the book did, in fact, represent. Then he 
attacked it. I wrote a book about the relationship between Christianity and 
Hinduism and the reviewer in the Christian Century said it’s about Christianity 
and Buddhism. He hadn't even read it! I find this occurs quite often. I really 
don’t get reviewed. For example, the last book I wrote was called The Book: 
On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, and sold thousands and thousands 
of copies. It’s hardly been reviewed at all. 

Uncerer: Do you still consider yourself an exponent of Zen? You seemed 
to have moved away from it in many ways. 

Warts: I don’t use a label. I try to say I’m not any kind of religionist. Zen 
is something like ophthalmology. It’s correction of conception. I don’t say Zen 
is what I’m trying to sell. Because to Western ears, that sounds exotic, like 


346 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


an imported fad. I want to think and talk within the framework of Western 
science and discourse so that we don’t have to appeal to any kind of exotic 
mumbo-jumbo, although at the same time, I want to say that, from studying 
these things in Oriental culture, I have learned a great deal. They’ve been very 
valuable to me. But what I have learned is not something that I should come 
on with like a missionary. Missionaries have the preconceived idea that they 
know what’s right without examining, except in the most patronizing way, that 
what we believe is right. 

Uncerer: Do you think there is a growing awareness at the so-called grass- 
roots about what you are trying to get at? 

Warts: Yes, I do. 

Uncerer: The trouble in this country. What is your view about it? 

Watts: Don’t forget, we are the richest country in the world. People are 
bothered because they are not rich enough and they think everything will be 
solved if they get enough. Then they get it and they start worrying about their 
health. There’s always something to worry about. When you compare the U. 
S. with India, India is in the most ghastly poverty. Even our slum dwellers are 
rich beyond the dreams of a Calcutta slum dweller. But we have a different 
worry. The technology we have has just amplified this worry so that it becomes 
extraordinarily dangerous. So our particular problems are about the ghettos, 
race, and one of the great problems, the older people hating the young people. 
They actually want to get rid of them. There are too many of them. The 
population is increasing. This manifests itself with all sorts of rationalizations 
to divert attention from the actual fact that older people want to get rid of 
their kids—don’t take them to a party, get a sitter, get them out of sight, etc. 
So we send them to Viet Nam to get killed off. And this lies behind the whole 
Chicago incident during the convention. The police today stand as the hired 
agents of the people who feel that they have only certain security and don’t 
want anybody to rock the boat. So they get these unconscious homosexuals, 
the tough guy types, the over-specialized males, to beat up the so-called sissies. 
Because, you see, that kind of man, when he sees the long hair and the flower 
power stuff thinks it’s sissified. They feel that way about the kids. Because 
these kids characteristically are quiet. They are only moved to aggression by 
the sorts of things that happened in Chicago. This goes back, of course, to 
some very fundamental questions in our culture. The paradox in American 
culture is that we are a republic which is a form of government in which the 
people are supposed to rule themselves, but our metaphysical presuppositions 
are monarchical. Any Christian or Jew believes the universe is a monarchy. 
Well, then, how can you say the republic is the best form of government? So 
when we take the republic seriously, the monarchy people feel threatened. We 
have, in other words, a very serious problem about the conflict of church and 
state. What has created the crime problem is basically that we are asking the 
police to be armed clergymen and enforce laws against prostitution, gambling, 


AN INTERVIEW WITH ALAN WATTS 347 


fornication, etc., which primarily are a matter of personal morals. Now a ques- 
tion that needs no answer is what kind of person would volunteer to serve 
on a vice squad? What kind of man would volunteer to peek through holes 
in toilets to detect homosexual acts? We know the only kind of persons who 
could possibly volunteer are creeps. So, you can’t reform the police. You can’t 
say let’s upgrade training, etc.; you can’t do it. But what you can do with one 
stroke of the pen is take all matters of private morals out of the hands of 
their jurisdiction. 

Uncerer: Do you think we are coming to that? 

Watts: Well, it’s got to happen because the police are overburdened. Their 
energies are vitally needed to control traffic, prevent ordinary street muggings, 
etc. If they were restricted to that, we wouldn't have the police problem we 
have today. 

Uncerer: Is it a matter of doing some of these things or we'll all go under? 

Warts: Yes it is. One of the people running around the US. today and 
talking about these things and one with whom I have a great deal of personal 
sympathy is Buckminster Fuller. He’s the most hopeful man talking today and 
I very much agree with him. He has the idea that he calls synergy. This means 
that in any complex organization the intelligence of the whole organization is 
greater than any one of its parts. Therefore, organic man may be a great deal 
more intelligent than conceptual man. Man, as he is, the brain, the nervous 
system, is more intelligent than man as he conceives himself to be ideologically, 
religiously, politically, psychologically. So, through the extension of the nervous 
system, through radio communication, jet aircraft, everything is being tied 
together. Thus, an organization is developing that is not being controlled by any 
kind of conscious programming, but by its own nature. And he’s saying that 
that organization is more intelligent. An example. It’s the nature of jet planes 
that they must keep flying or they will deteriorate. So we have a tremendous 
interest in maintaining this transportation system. Now all customer barriers, 
passport barriers are in the way of the air lines. They are a nuisance. They 
are going to have to go. Also, any sort of war interferes with the schedule. 
People want to travel. Wars get in the way. What technology is doing is that 
it’s a process where we progressively realize where we were in the first place. 
The bat has something like radar. The human being temporarily has lost his 
instincts and is creating them technologically. Then he may rediscover that he 
had them all the time. 

Uncerer: And then we'll talk to the porpoise. 

Watts: Sure. I was talking to John Lilly, who knows more about the 
porpoise than anybody. He was saying, look, this creature does not need any 
appliances. It lives in the water with the grocery right in front of it and if it 
isn’t right there, it’s just a matter of a short swim away. It doesn’t need clothes, 
a house, books, records, because the body of the creature is its culture. These 
are highly intelligent, essentially playful beings. Their only problem is that they 


348 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


cannot stay under the water very long. They have to keep surfacing, therefore, 
they have to stay alert. Beyond that, they have it made. 

Uncerer: And man’s problems? 

Warts: His problems seem to lie largely in his system of thinking. That 
is to say, thinking is a method of representing events in the physical world 
with symbols. Now this has great advantages, but its disadvantage is that one 
confuses the world as symbolized with the world that is. You can’t confuse the 
map with the territory, the menu with the meal. We have to get back to a direct 
relationship with the physical world. Even when one says “physical world,” that 
is a concept. Physical is an Aristotelian idea about the nature of things. The 
problem is in confusing the world thought about with the world that is; we eat 
the menu and not the dinner. We've created a culture which has a reputation 
for being materialistic and isn’t materialistic at all. It’s sort of the reverse of 
Plato’s cave, where the people are looking at the shadows on the walls. 


CHAPTER THIRTY 


Psychotherapy and Eastern Religion 


Metaphysical Bases of Psychiatry (1974) 


panes I should first explain that I have been involved with psy- 
chotherapy for years, and talking to the staffs of psychiatric insti- 
tutions has been one of the main things I do. Something that has constantly 
worried me about almost all the schools of psychotherapy is what I’m going 
to call a lack of metaphysical depth, a certain shallowness that results from 
having a philosophical unconscious that has not been examined. Now, I’m a 
philosopher, and as a philosopher I am grateful to some of the great pioneers 
in psychotherapy like Freud, Jung, and Adler, for pointing out to us philosophers 
the unconscious emotional forces that underlie our opinions. In a way, I’m also 
a theologian, but not a partisan theologian. I don’t belong to any particular 
religion because I don’t consider that to be intellectually respectable. We are 
grateful for their showing us how our unconscious and unexamined emotional 
tendencies influence the ideas that we hold. It’s a very valuable insight. Be we, 
in our turn, are interested in the unconscious intellectual assumptions that 
underlie psychotherapy. 

Psychotherapy is a product of the philosophy of nature of the nineteenth 
century. From my point of view, that is not an exact science but a mythology 
that is taken for granted. The philosophy of nature of the nineteenth century 
has become the common sense of the twentieth century, and is widely accepted 
in the medical profession, in the psychotherapeutic professions, and in sociology. 
From the point of view of a physicist or an advanced mathematician or biolo- 
gist, however, there is a serious question as to whether psychiatry is a genuine

350 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


science, and even whether medicine is a genuine science. These professions have 
not caught up with quantum theory and are still holding Newtonian views of 
the universe, thinking about their subjects in terms of mechanical models. We 
hear constant reference to “unconscious mental mechanisms.” What on earth are 
we talking about? Psychoanalysis is to a very large degree psychohydraulics—an 
analogy or model of the behavior of the so-called psyche based on Newtonian 
analysis of the mechanics of water—and so we hear of a basic notion of psychic 
energy as libido. Now libido means “blind lust,” and it operates according to 
the pleasure principle that comes into conflict with something else called the 
reality principle. One of the difficulties of the human being is that the whole 
length of the spinal cord separates the brain from the genitals, and so they’re 
never quite together... . 

We are looking at the basic models underlying the practice of psycho- 
therapy. There are exceptions to this and you must always understand that I’m 
going to make exaggerations and outrageous generalizations for purposes of 
discussion rather than laying down the law. Our practice is based on the world 
view of nineteenth-century scientific naturalism, which has as its fundamental 
assumption that the energy that we express is basically stupid—blind energy, 
libido—and it’s called the unconscious. The assumption of this philosophy of 
nature was that the psychobiology of human nature was a stupid mechanism, 
a fluke that had arisen in a mechanical universe, and if we were to maintain 
this fluke and its values, it would be necessary for us to enter into a serious 
fight with nature. Scientific naturalism was in fact against nature, believing 
nature to be foolish and blind, and therefore in need of being dominated by 
our intelligence that, paradoxically enough, was the product of this foolishness. 
But the fluke had happened. 

Let’s go back into the history of this idea. Western man, whether he was a 
Jew, a Moslem or a Christian, had always considered the natural universe to be 
an artifact, something made, and a child in this culture very naturally seems to 
ask its parents, “How was I made?” To make something is to create an artifact; 
you make a table out of wood or a sculpture out of stone. This is the basic 
mythology underlying our common sense. We are mostly unconscious of the 
basic images in which we think. That is why I say that we have an intellectual 
unconscious. We are mostly unconscious of the basic belief systems within 
which we think and behave. So here is this basic belief system—we are all 
made. It would be unnatural for a Chinese child to ask, “How was I made?” 
He might instead ask, “How did I grow?” The idea of our being manufactured 
objects is basic to almost all Western thought. In the course of history, when 
we got rid of the idea of God as the maker, we were stuck with the idea of 
the universe as a mechanism. 

People today who believe in God don’t really believe in God; they believe 
that they ought to believe in God, and therefore are somewhat fanatical about it 
because of their doubt. The strong believer always profoundly doubts what he 


PSYCHOTHERAPY AND EASTERN RELIGION 351 


believes and therefore wants to compel other people to believe, to bolster up his 
own courage. A person who truly believes in God would never try and thrust 
the idea on anyone else, just as when you understand mathematics, you are not 
a fanatical proponent of the idea that two and two are four. . . . Nevertheless we 
have been stuck with the assumption that the universe is a mechanical construct. 

Now, what is the difference between a mechanism and an organism? A 
mechanism is an arrangement of parts that are put together, gathered, as it 
were, from separate places and assembled. No organism comes into being that 
way. An organism starts as a seed, or a cell, a little small . . . I’m at a loss for 
words, because I won't call it an object, and I won't call it a thing, and I won't 
even call it an entity. All these words misdescribe what an organism is. Anyway, 
it starts tiny, and it swells, and as it swells, it becomes more complicated, not 
by the addition of parts that are screwed on or welded together, but it has 
this marvelous capacity of growth... and that’s how we came into being. 
An organism is incredibly intelligent, and its intelligence surpasses anything 
we might call mechanical intelligence. In physics, where there are millions 
of variables, we manage to understand them by statistical methods and then 
predict what will happen. But in the ordinary situations of life where we are 
dealing with perhaps several hundred thousand variables, we haven't the ghost 
of a notion how to handle them. 

For example, you can’t possibly keep up with the literature that you need 
to know in the field of psychotherapy. It’s endless, and most of it boring. We 
all become scanning lines, because conscious attention is the brain’s radar, and 
you know how radar works. It is the propagation of a beam with a bounce 
factor in it that feeds back to the scope, and you keep scanning the environment 
for changes. If a rock should come up, if a storm should come up, if another 
vehicle should come up, the radar picks it up. Our conscious attention is only 
a minimal part of our total psychic functioning, because the brain as a whole, 
the nervous system as a whole, regulates and organizes all kinds of psychic and 
physical functioning without thinking about it. You don’t know how you beat 
your heart. You don’t know how you make a decision. You don’t know how 
you breathe. You may, if you’re a physiologist, have some idea of it, but that 
doesn’t enable you to do it any better than somebody who doesn’t know. All 
this incredibly intricate functioning is carried on unconsciously. Oh, we say, it’s 
by the brain. But what is the brain? Nobody really knows. 

One of my great friends is Karl Pribram, who is a professor of neuropsy- 
chiatry at Stanford. He has a marvelous understanding of the brain, but he is 
the first person to admit that he doesn’t really understand it at all. He’s fasci- 
nated, and he shows us most amazing things—how the brain creates the world 
that it sees. If you want a simple explanation of this, read J. Z. Young’s (1960) 
book, Doubt and Certainty in Science. He begins with the brains of octopuses, 
which are very simple brains and fairly easy to understand, and then he goes 
on to the human brain and shows how we are what we are by creating the 


352 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


kind of world that we think we live in. The brain, the nervous system, evokes 
the world, but is also something in the world. What an egg-and-hen situation 
that is! He is stating in very sophisticated language some ancient philosophical 
problems. When Bishop Berkeley explained that the world is entirely in our 
minds, he had a very vague idea of the mind. Everybody used to think that 
the mind was something like space. It had no form of its own but was able to 
contain forms, like a mirror that has no color but reflects all colors, like the 
eye lens that has no color but is able to see all colors. This was a vague idea 
of the mind. Now the neurologist studying the brain gets a very precise idea 
of the mind. He can say it has all these neurons, dendrites and what have you, 
pathways. But in the end, he comes to exactly the same thing. He’s saying, the 
world is what your brain evokes. So we’re back where we started, only in a 
more complicated and more rigorous way. Nature is assumed to be complex. 
We say, the world is complicated, not only in its biology, in its geology, in 
its astronomy, but also in its politics, its economics. Actually the world isn’t 
complicated at all. What is complicated is the attempt to translate the world 
into linear symbols. 

What I’m developing is the idea that what we are physically is far more 
intelligent than what we are intellectually. Behind our minds and our books and 
our schedules and our laws and our mathematics, there is something far more 
intelligent than anything we can record. So naturally, when you get into the 
practice of psychotherapy, you have first of all gone through school, and you’ve 
read a lot of textbooks, and you've seen a lot of procedures and heard a lot of 
explanations. Incidentally, do you know what “explained” means? It means “to 
lay out flat, to put it on a plain.” It’s like those slices people take of fetuses, and 
enlarge them and so on, to see what a fetus really is. You've got it explained. 
But a fetus “laid out flat” is no fetus, just like blood in a test tube is not the 
same process as blood in the veins—because it’s out of context. Blood in the 
veins is in a certain situation. It is what it is because of its relationship to a 
vast system. But in a test tube where it’s isolated, it’s not the same thing. A 
thing is also where it is. 

Let us begin to realize that we have identified ourselves with a process 
of mentation or consciousness that is not really ourselves at all. Let’s have the 
humility to see that. We don’t trust ourselves because of this, and therefore 
scientists are sometimes saying today, “Human civilization has come to the 
point where we've got to take our own evolution in hand. We can no longer 
leave it to the spontaneous processes of nature.” Well, these people are idiots. 
Like a conference of geneticists that I recently attended: they summoned for 
advice several philosophers and theologians—that showed they were pretty 
desperate—and they said, “We have just realized that we’re within reach of the 
power to control human character by genetic manipulation. We want to know 
what you people think about this. What sort of human character should we 
produce?” Wowee! There were various views offered, and I said, “Of course 


PSYCHOTHERAPY AND EASTERN RELIGION 353 


you can't know, because you yourself are genetically unregenerate. You yourself 
are the product of the random selection of nature, and therefore by your own 
showing, you must be a mess. You, as a mess, cannot decide what should be 
the proper order of things. The only thing you can do is to ensure that there 
be as many different kinds of human being as possible.” 

We don’t know what kinds of human beings we need. At one period, 
we need people who cooperate and who are good team-workers. At another 
period, we need rugged individualists who have their own ideas and go ahead 
and persuade everybody else to follow them. We’re in a teamwork situation 
right now. Everybody is always looking out of the corner of their eye to see 
what everybody else is doing. What is the right way to proceed evolutionarily? 
We haven't the faintest idea. We all seem to agree that we should survive. I’m 
not at all sure about this. There are two schools of thought about life. Take 
the analogy of fire: some people think a good fire is a colossally bright blaze 
that is a flash, like lightning. Other people say, “Oh, no, no, that’s a waste of 
energy. Cool it. Keep it down to a dull glow that goes on for a long, long time, 
so that ‘this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper.’” What 
should life be? Suppose you were confronted with a choice: you could spend 
one night with the most beautiful woman imaginable, or man, and have the 
most incredible orgiastic experience, and then die. Or, you could be with some 
rather indifferent, not very exciting companion for a long, long time, so that 
you would be bored. Which would you choose? We find that very difficult to 
decide. In the ordinary way, we are not really aware of life because we're using 
our conscious attention too much. We think we are our opinion of ourselves, 
our image of ourselves, and therefore feel reduced to linear symbolism, and 
that’s a kind of strung-out, skinny thing. It’s starved. It’s all skin and bones and 
no flesh. When you think of yourself as your ego, as your personality, this is 
an entirely fictitious account of yourself, lacking in richness; if you are identi- 
fied with that, you feel impoverished, and you have to go to a psychiatrist. You 
say, I feel frustrated. Of course you do. The psychiatrist also feels frustrated, 
because, by and large, he has the same opinion of himself; he thinks he’s an ego. 

Freedom is the only thing that works. If I don’t trust you, I can’t live with 
you. I’ve got to make the gamble, even though it will sometimes be betrayed. 
I’ve got to make the gamble of trusting you. I can’t go out of my door without 
a fundamental sense that I can trust my neighbors. So in the same way, I can- 
not make a single decision without the fundamental sense of trusting my own 
brain. If I don’t know how my brain works, how the hell do I know if I’m not 
crazy? I have no way of determining. I may be absolutely nutty as a fruitcake, 
but nevertheless, I have to trust my brain. The trouble with most people we 
call crazy is that they can’t trust themselves. Clinically, one has somehow or 
other to get these people to trust themselves again. You can’t do that if you’re 
uptight. If you, in the company of a so-called crazy person, feel ill-at-ease, and 
feel that you’ve got to get this person to conform and do things according to 


354 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


the book, you're going to get nowhere. You've got to be able, yourself, to be 
as crazy as a crazy person in order to be a therapist. 

The therapist must, above all things, have a basic trust in life, in the 
unconscious. The unconscious shouldn’t be a noun. It’s a verb, the unconscious 
aspect of process, of nature. If you don’t trust it, you get clutched up in the 
situation where you can’t really do anything. Our technology is basically a 
mistrust of nature and, clever as it is, it’s not going to work in the long run. 
Our technology is going to destroy us, unless we upend it, and base it on trust 
in the processes of life. 

The basis of what we're going into is what I have called the intellectual 
unconscious. Nowadays it’s customary, especially in psychological circles, to put 
down intellectual considerations. Such words are used as being “overcerebral,” as 
being on a “head trip,” as dismissing it all as “a lot of talk,” but the fact remains 
that those comments on intellectualization are an expression of a philosophy— 
and at that, an unexamined one. You will often come across a type who says, 
“[’m just a practical businessman. I don’t give a shit about philosophy. I’ve got 
to get things done.” And so that fellow is advertising himself as a member of 
a particular philosophical school called pragmatism. He doesn’t know this, and 
because he doesn’t know it he’s bad pragmatist. He says, “I want to get things 
done.” Or, he’s the sort of person who says, “You can’t stop progress.” But 
what is being practical? This is a very, very undecided question, and for a lot 
of people, their only idea of what is practical is what enables them to survive. 
Well, this can be thoroughly called into question. 

I mean, is it a good idea to survive? Most people have never thought about 
that at all. Albert Camus (1960), in his book, The Myth of Sisyphus, starts out 
by saying, “The only serious philosophical question is whether or not to com- 
mit suicide.” Now, in your profession, suicide is a major evil. I once went to a 
conference held by the American Academy of Psychotherapists on the subject of 
“Failure in Psychotherapy,” and various papers were presented. The first paper 
contained a case study of someone who had been under therapy for five years 
and then committed suicide. So I said, “This is rather a funny case because, 
after all, you kept the guy alive for five years, and in the treatment of cancer 
that would have been counted as a cure. The statistics on cancer treatment 
always reckon five years’ survival as a cure. What’s so bad about suicide? After 
all, we’re overpopulated, and if someone doesn’t want to be around anymore, 
that’s their privilege. All I’m saying is that that assumption is questionable. 
Furthermore, what are you afraid of about death?” 

This is a real hospital hang-up. We don’t know how to treat dying people. 
The literature on the psychotherapy of the dying has only just begun to come 
into existence, and a doctor is in a very tough position because he’s supposed 
to keep you alive, at all costs. The most heroic measures are used to keep 
people alive, and there they suffer, linked up with all kinds of tubes and kidney 
machines and various systems—because at all costs while there is life there is 


PSYCHOTHERAPY AND EASTERN RELIGION 355 


hope, and often while there is life there is pain. The doctor is sort of out of 
the role when he knows in his heart that the patient will not live, and then all 
kinds of lying starts up. He may tell the patient’s relatives that the case is hope- 
less, but he says to them, “Don’t tell the patient.” For some reason, knowing 
that you're going to die is supposed to be bad for you. It’s supposed to depress 
you. It’s supposed to perhaps cut down the recuperative forces of nature that 
are at work in your organism. 

But the most important thing for anybody to know is that he’s going to 
die. Oh, we can put it off and say, “Well, we’ll think about that later.” But we 
don’t realize that the certainty of death is an extremely liberating experience. I’ve 
never been a doctor of medicine, but I’ve been a “doctor of divinity” . . . under 
rather strange circumstances. I’ve often been called in when people are dying, 
because when the doctor gives up, he calls the clergyman, and the clergyman 
feels in role at this point, although he may be a silly idiot and make all sorts 
of consolations and tell you about heaven and hell and such things. But that’s 
not the way to work. Dying is a splendid opportunity, and the sooner one can 
realize fully the certainty of death the better. 

The hospital is, by and large, a terrible place, although its intentions are 
very good. But the last place I would send anyone is to a mental hospital, and if 
possible, not even to a physical hospital. I had a friend recently who was dying 
of cancer—he had a brain tumor. And here he was in a Kaiser Hospital, in 
the most horrible surroundings. You know what hospital rooms are—colorless, 
healthy, hygienic, awful. And here he was, you know, he could hardly look out 
of the window even. And I said to him, “Harry, listen, I don’t know, I haven’t 
talked to your doctor, and I don’t know what your condition really is, so don’t 
take anything I say about your condition as being true, but let’s just suppose 
for the sake of argument that it’s hopeless. Suppose you're going to die. You 
may not be, but suppose it is so. Now you know enough, because you're well 
educated in Oriental philosophy, to realize that the best thing that could possibly 
happen to you is to lose your ego and be liberated. After all, that’s what you've 
been concerned with all your life, the sense of transcending the narrow bounds 
of self-consciousness and feeling one with the universe, with the eternal energy 
behind all this, and the only way to get that feeling is to give yourself up.” I 
said, “Here’s the opportunity. There’s no question of holding on to yourself 
anymore, because it’s going to go away, and nothing can stop it, so get with it. 
Just give up, and get out of this place, and rent yourself a beach cottage and 
look out at the ocean, and stop all this concern to hang on.” 

Hanging onto oneself is self-strangulation. It’s like smother-love. When a 
mother hangs on to her child too long and doesn’t let it be independent because 
of her concern, or alleged love, the child becomes warped. Well, it’s the same, 
you can smother-love yourself. You can hang on. You can be full of anxiety. I 
know and you know, for many people this is a regular program. They’re anx- 
ious because they don’t have enough money, and they think, If only I could 


356 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


double my income, everything would be okay. And they succeed. They do it. 
So they have plenty of money. Then the next thing they worry about is their 
health. They go to the doctor and they get a complete medical examination, and 
the doctor says, “As far as I can see, you're all right.” Well, they think there’s 
something probably wrong, because this person is a born worrier and maybe 
should go to a psychiatrist. So he looks you over and yes, “I can’t see anything 
wrong.” Well, then, you worry about politics. Is the revolution coming? Are 
the tax people going to take away all your money? Will you be robbed? I mean, 
there are endless contingencies you can worry about. 

And finally, death. Am I going to die? Of course. How soon? Does that 
matter? What are you waiting for? There’s a song, you know, which used to 
go... “There’s a good time coming, be it ever so far away,” and everybody 
thinks there is one far off divine event to which all creation moves, and maybe 
that'll turn up between now and your death . . . or even perhaps after death. 
Everybody’s looking for that thing somewhere else than now. But if you accept 
death, a funny thing happens—you discover how good now is, and that’s really 
where you're supposed to be. Very often people may get into these states when 
they’re threatened by death, when they've given themselves up for dead, or 
sometimes, too, in convalescing from a long illness. In those transformed states 
of consciousness in which we see this, there’s a sudden enlightenment about now. 

When you see that the whole point of life is this moment, most other people 
seem objects of pity. You’re rather sorry for them. Because they are rushing 
around, madly intent on something. They look insane on the streets. Going 
somewhere. Wow, it’s important to get there. And their noses seem to be lon- 
ger than usual, sort of prodding into the future, and their eyes staring. They 
rush about in cars. Looking out of the window I see all these cars streaming 
down Lake Shore Drive into Chicago. They’re intent on something. What? 
Well, we have to go to work. Why? Well, to make money. Why? Well, I mean 
one must live. You must? If you say to any spontaneous process—and life is a 
spontaneous process—‘You must happen,” it’s like saying to someone, “You 
must love me.” But we all do that to our children. The basic rule for bringing 
up a child—which every child learns—is, “You are required and commanded to 
do that which will be acceptable only if you do it voluntarily.” That is known as 
the double-bind. So we say to our spouses “You must love me,” and if I don’t 
feel like loving my spouse anymore, I’m made to feel guilty, and when I feel 
guilty, I feel I have to make an effort to be loving—but nobody wants to be 
loved on purpose. I don’t want to be loved out of somebody’s sense of duty. 
I want them to love me because they can’t help loving me. Then I feel okay. 

Ever so many people are thoroughly confused by being commanded to 
do that which is only any good if it’s natural—and living is such a thing. If I 
say to myself, “I must live,” then life is a drag. Or I say, “I must live because 
I have children and I’m responsible.” But then all I do is teach my children 
to have the same feeling, and they will teach their children to have the same 


PSYCHOTHERAPY AND EASTERN RELIGION 357 


feeling, and life will continue to be a drag for everybody concerned. So life 
can only not be a drag when you understand it’s gravy. That is to say, it hap- 
pens unnecessarily, not under orders, but for kicks. Then you are free from 
the oppressive duty to go on living. And so the physician, and especially the 
psychiatrist, should be the first person to understand this. Jung once made a 
joke, “Life is a disease with a very bad prognosis. It lingers on for years and 
invariably ends with death.” .. . So, death is most important, but of course, 
Westerners, particularly, are scared of it. It’s the one awful awful that mustn't 
happen, because, well... why are we afraid of it? Some of us say, “It’s not 
death I’m afraid of, it’s dying.” Well, that makes sense, but then medicine 
doesn’t help: medicine prolongs dying. It doesn’t really prolong life, I mean, 
it does sometimes, but for old people particularly, it prolongs dying. Terminal 
cancer is prolonged dying. 

Still, there is something real spooky about death. Even if you’re not 
religious and you don't believe in an afterlife that might be awful, I mean, 
who knows? But supposing death is like going to sleep and never waking up. 
That’s quite something to think about. I find thinking about death is one of 
the most creative things one can do. To go to sleep and never wake up. Fancy 
that. It won't be like going into the dark forever. It won't be like being buried 
alive forever. There'll be no problems at all; there’s nothing to regret. It will 
be as if you had never existed at all, and not only you, but everything else as 
well. It never was there. No further problems. But wait a minute. I seem to 
remember something like that. That was just the way it was before I was born. 
And yet, here I am. I exist, and once, I didn’t. Nor did anything else, so far as 
I am concerned. And I always figure in life that a thing that happened once 
can always happen again. So I came out of nothing. But we say, “You couldn’t 
have done that, because there’s nothing in nothing to produce something, and 
we believe in the Latin precept, ex nihilo nihil fit, which means ‘out of nothing 
comes nothing.’” But it’s not true. It’s a fault in our logic. If you had Chinese 
logic, you would see it differently. You would see that you have to have nothing 
in order to have something, because the two go together. 

Well, isn’t that obvious? Where would the stars be without space? There 
would be nowhere for them to be . . . and they shine out of space. Physicists 
are just beginning to realize that it is precisely space that is the creative matrix, 
the womb of creation. So in the same way, look at your head. What color is 
it? I can’t even find mine. You all have heads, but I don’t: I can’t see my head. 
And I also don’t feel with my eyes that there is a back blob in the middle of 
everything I experience. It isn’t even fuzzy. It just isn’t there, although neuro- 
logically speaking, all that I call outside is a state of the optic nerves that are 
located in the back of the head. So I’m looking at the inside of my head. It’s 
pretty weird. So out of this nothingness comes my sight. Out of the space 
come the stars. So, you can regard death as the origin of life, for how would 
you know you are alive unless you had once been dead. Think that one over. 


358 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


We think we are alive, don’t we?—Something we can’t quite put our finger 
on, but we know there is such a thing as reality, as existence. We're here. And 
everything we know is known by contrast. You know you can see light against 
a background of darkness, hot as compared with cold, pain compared with 
pleasure. So we know we're alive. Obviously we must have once been dead. 
This seems to me very plain. 

So, you say, “Well now, wait a minute. When I come back again, if this 
does happen again, this sense of existence, in what form will I come back?” I 
hope I could be a human being again, or an angel, but perhaps I’ll come back 
as a fruit fly, or a hippopotamus.” But be assured it won’t make any difference. 
All beings think they’re human. We don’t like to admit that because we think 
we're top species, but that doesn’t follow at all. That’s just our opinion, and we’re 
very conceited. We say of somebody who is very ill, “Oh, it’s too bad. He’s just 
become a vegetable” . . . with the most extraordinary ignorance of vegetables. 
We think vegetables are unintelligent, unfeeling, but vegetables are highly intel- 
ligent organisms, and tests with electroencephalograms show that they feel. Now, 
if you came back as a vegetable, you would have vegetable consciousness, and 
you would think that was entirely normal . . . in fact, civilized, the usual thing, 
the regular thing. You would understand your fellow vegetables and the bees 
that visited you, and that would be the normal routine. You would think human 
beings were ridiculous. Human beings, in order to consider themselves civilized, 
have to accumulate enormous quantities of rubbish. They have to have clothes, 
cars, libraries, houses . . . all this junk. Whereas, look at us vegetables—our bod- 
ies are our culture, and we’re not ashamed of them. Look at the flower. Isn’t 
that something? Fish would have the same view. We think sharks are terrible, 
but they at least stay in the ocean. Human beings go everywhere, into the sky, 
into the ocean, and all over the earth catching their prey. But the civilized shark 
stays in the water at least. Look at the dolphins. Why, they are quite probably 
more intelligent than we. But they decided that our game was stupid. Stay in 
the water because the groceries are right there, and you can spend most of your 
time playing. And so that’s just what the dolphins do. They gambol all over the 
place, and, for example, they’ll follow a human ship and swim circles around 
it; then they'll set their tail at a twenty-six degree angle and let the bow-wake 
carry them. No effort, see .. . just keep your tail that way and the ship will 
take you along. Where to? Who cares? 

Everywhere is the place to go, to be at. It’s like a king. When a king walks, 
he is stately. Why? Because he has nowhere to go to. Because he is where he is 
at. He’s the place, wherever he moves. So he walks in a stately way. He doesn’t 
march, he doesn’t hurry—he’s there. Everybody must learn, then, to walk like a 
king. You can remember this because, in Sanskrit, your real self is called atman. 
Making a pun that scholars would deplore, that means the “man where it’s at,” 
and where it’s at is where you are. But we’re all under the illusion that we 
should be someone and somewhere else. So we’re not seated properly. That’s 


PSYCHOTHERAPY AND EASTERN RELIGION 359 


why, when you practice yoga, the first thing you have to learn is to sit in such 
a way that you're really there. So, by the acceptance of death, one overcomes 
the necessity for a future, and that in both senses of the word is a present. 

You can see this more clearly perhaps if you would imagine what it would 
be like to regress, as it’s called in psychotherapeutic language, to babyhood. 
And, here you are. You really don’t know anything about anything. All you 
know is what you feel. You’ve no sense of time. You don’t know the differ- 
ence between who you are and what you see. You're in what Freud called the 
“oceanic state.” You don’t know anything. You don’t know any language, no 
words in your head. Now consider what it would be like to stop thinking, stop 
talking to yourself, and simply be aware. You hear all the sound going on but 
you don’t put names on them. You see all these colors and forms buzzing at 
you, but you don’t call them anything. You just experience. 

That’s a pretty crazy state of consciousness because there’s no past, there’s 
no future, there’s no difference between you and what you're aware of. It’s 
all one, or none, or both, or neither—there are no words. You would be in 
a state that in yoga is called nirvikalpa samadhi, a very high consciousness in 
which illusions vanish—Eternal Now. Incidentally, a very therapeutic state of 
consciousness. But that is a kind of metaphorical death. It is the death of your 
self-image, your idea of yourself, your concept of yourself. Literal death, or the 
immediate prospect thereof, can bring a person into that state of consciousness. 
This state of consciousness is highly invigorating, because all the energy that 
you were wasting on worrying is now available for other things. All the energy 
you were wasting on trying to hold onto yourself is now available for things 
that can be done, and so people, paradoxically it would seem, are very pepped 
up by the acceptance of death in its various senses. So a hospital, where many 
people are in one way or another dying, should be a place of immense joy. 
But we don’t allow it to be that, because we have the fixed idea that people in 
the hospital are in trouble, and we show them by the way in which we attend 
and relate to them emotionally: “Yes, you are in trouble.” Well then, of course 
they feel in trouble. They have to play that role. 

There is nothing that causes more trouble to people than helping them. 
There’s a famous saying, “Kindly let me help you or you'll drown,” said the 
monkey, putting the fish safely up a tree. The moment you take this attitude 
of “You are sick,” people learn to eat pity, and thrive on it, and play sick as a 
profitable role for getting attention, sympathy, care, and to indulge in the mas- 
ochism of gaining a sense of identity through being in peril, in misfortune. It’s 
like the phrase, “nursing a grievance.” I once had a woman come to me who 
had had a very serious tragedy. Her husband had died of a heart attack and a 
year later her son was struck by lightning and killed. She was beside herself 
with grief. Understandably. Well, at the time, I was a clergyman. And I took a 
look at this woman and I thought, I’m not going to give her any bullshit, she’s 
too intelligent. So I asked her to explore grief. What is it to grieve? Where do 


360 PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 


you feel grief? What part of your body is it in? What sort of a feeling is it? 
What images are connected with it? In every way we explored grief. And by 
God, she got over it. Because eventually, concentrating on it as a sensation, she 
stopped talking to herself and saying, “Poor little me, I’ve lost my son, I’ve 
lost my husband,” and repeating all these words over and over that hypnotize 
you and perpetuate the feeling of being important because you're in a state of 
grief. And she became an extremely creative and active person. 

So it seems to me that anybody in the hospital professions, the healing 
professions, must get the hang of this somehow, and stop running desultory 
institutions. There’s no reason why hospitals should be designed the way they 
are. Hospitals should be arranged in such a way as to make being sick an inter- 
esting experience. One learns a great deal sometimes from being sick. Dying 
only happens to you once, so it should be a great event. Special sanitariums, 
not hospitals—‘“sanitarium” means “a place of sanity”—should be arranged for 
different methods of dying. How would you like to die? Do you want a very, 
very marvelous religious ceremony? Do you want to invite all your friends 
to a champagne party? Do you want to be among flowers? How would you 
like to die if you really had your choice? Would you like to be drowned in a 
barrel of wine? You could take an extremely positive attitude to death as the 
greatest opportunity you'll ever have to experience what it’s like to let go of 
yourself . . . than which there is no greater bliss.

RELIGIOUS STUDIES PHILOSOPHY / BUDDHIST STUDIES 


To commemorate the 2015 centenary of the birth of Alan Watts (1915-1973), 
Poter J. Columbus and Donadrian L, Rice have assembled a much-needed 
collection of Watts’s scholarly essays and bectures. Compiled from professional 
journals, monographs, scholarly books, conferences, and symposia 
proceedings, the volume sheds valuable light on the developmental 
arc of Watts'’s thinking about language and mysticiam, Buddhism and Zen, 
Christianity, comparative religion, paychedelics, and psychology and 
paychotherapy. This definitive collection challenges Watis’s reputation a6 8 
“popularize” of “philosophical entertainer,” nevialing his concairns to be much 
more expansive and transdisciplinary than 6 suggested by the parochial “Zen 
Buddhist” label commonly affixed to his writings. The editors’ authoritative 
introduction elucidates contemporary perspectives on Watts’s life and work, 
and supports a bold rethinking of his contributions to paychology, philosophy, 
and religion, 


"This excellent volume is important in establishing Watts as perhaps 
the mest important Westem thinker and writer on Eastern religions and 
philosophy, a5 well as comparative religions, of the twentieth century.” 
—John W. Traphagan, author of 
Rethinking Autonomy: A Critique of Principiism in Biomedical Ethics 


PETER J. COLUMBUS is Administrater of the Shantigar Foundation in Rowe, 
Massachusetts. DONADRIAN L. RICE is Professor of Psychology at the 
University of West Georgia. Together they are the coeditors of Alan Watts— 
Here and Now: Contributions to Psychology, Philosophy, and Religion, also 
published by SUNY Press.
