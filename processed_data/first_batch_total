In the years after his death, and due much to his popularity among wide-ranging audiences, Watts was mostly marginalized by those in higher education."

Two components of the debate are relevant here. First is the problem of religious language, that is to say, the extent to which human linguistic forms limit, afford, or nullify veridical claims about God and mystical transcendence (Reed, 2007; White, 2010).

Second is the view that Watts arrogated Buddhism and constructed a philosophical commodity for consumption by an American constituency alienated from Cold War politics. Third is that Watts was signaling an Occidentalism, converting extant Japanese appraisals of American rationalism and materialism into therapeutic critiques of Cold War culture in America. Finally, Watts is seen as proffering a \u201cmodern Buddhism\u201d that is divergent from tradition, but congruent with the spiritual sensibilities of contemporary Western life."

For all these philosophies it is a first principle that the seeming separateness of the ego from the world, so that it could be its controller, is an illusion.

This knowledge consists, not in a verbal proposition, but in a psychological change, similar to that which occurs in the cure of a psychosis. One in whom this change has come to pass does not attempt to control the world, or himself, by the efforts of his own will. He learns the art of \u201cletting things happen,\u201d which is no mere passivity but, on the contrary, a creative technique familiar to the activity of many artists, musicians, and inventers in our own culture, whereby skill and insight are found to be the fruits of a certain \u201cdynamic relaxation.\u201d"

For in the philosophy attributed to Gautama by the earliest records no place is given to a God or gods who can assist man in the development of spiritual life; the existence of such divine beings is not denied\u2014it is ignored on the ground that no power on earth or in heaven can interfere with another\u2019s karma.

Before making these vows he had devoted himself, for an equally incomprehensible span of time, to innumerable good works, thus acquiring for himself a store of merit sufficient to give abundant aid to the whole world."

So, too, Shinran insists that we are saved by Amida just as we are, with all our imperfections. In other words, ordinary men are Buddhas just as they are, and, according to Hui-neng, of the Zen school, those whom we call Buddhas are simply those who understand this truth."

All ordinary things and experiences have opposites; life is opposed to death, pleasure to pain, joy to sorrow, and light to darkness. These opposites are necessary to one another, so that life is always limited by death, and joy by sorrow. But Reality itself has no opposite; it is advaita, nondual, and the soul of man is only delivered from death and sorrow by realizing its identity with Reality."

Not to realize this is ignorance (avidya) and unhappiness, but to know it is true knowledge (vidya) and a transcendental happiness which is eternal because, strange to say, it too has no opposite. Thus the religion of the Upanishads was more or less monistic, believing that all forms and objects were in fact manifestations of the One Absolute."

But whereas the Upanishads described the nondual Reality as the One, Mahayana felt this term misleading. One is opposed to Many and None, for which reason Reality must transcend even oneness.

        "output": "To say that all things are one is to reduce everything to something which is still short of nonduality, since one-ness has an opposite and so cannot be the Absolute. Furthermore, the very statement, \u201cAll things are Reality,\u201d contains an implied opposition between \u201call things\u201d and \u201cReality.\u201d In making such a statement we are uniting two things which are in no need of union. They are already united, and to try to create the union in thought or in feeling is to imply to oneself that it does not already exist. Nirvana (the sense of Reality) is Samsara (the state of ordinary life) and the very act of trying to realize that they are one implies that they are not."

        "output": "The genius of Zen lies in its way of pointing to the real now without distracting the attention with concepts. But the human mind, because of its inherently possessive nature, lets go of concepts with extreme reluctance, for which reason Zen has sometimes to attack and smash them quite violently. Thus its technique has often the appearance of spiritual shock-tactics."

        "output": "The occidental reader must not gather from the foregoing that Zen is an easy-going aestheticism, a philosophy of idling along with the stream of events. Zen has also been the religion of warriors who applied it on the battlefield in the very moment of danger: Under the sword raised high Is hell, making you tremble. But walk on!\u2014 And there is the Land of Bliss. The momentariness of Zen lies above and beyond the two wrong extremes of idling and hurrying, in an amazing poise, not of rigidity, but of balance in motion."

It is to be doubted, however, whether one can ground one\u2019s life in pure, essential Zen alone, for even as a specific religious cult Zen employs forms and symbols, and the normal structure of the Buddhist religion. For pure life expresses itself within and through structure. Life without structure is unseen; it is the unmanifested Absolute."

It suggests that it is an abiding experience that by no means fades with familiarity. Our best way of understanding it will be to follow, as best we can, the inner process through which the experience is realized. This will mean, in the first place, treating it from the psychological point of view, to find out whether the words express any psychological reality, let alone any logical sense or moral propriety."

We shall see that this is in many ways a rather unsatisfactory starting-point. The problem of telling anyone how to proceed from this point to the experience of unity reminds one of the yokel who was asked the way to an obscure village. He scratched his head for a while and then answered, \u201cWell, sir, I know where it is, but if I were you I wouldn't start from here.\u201d But unfortunately, this is just where we are."

Ignorance and wisdom are alike without difference, For you should know that the ten thousand things are all Suchness (tathata).

Similarly, when Joshu asked Nansen, \u201cWhat is the Tao?\u201d Nansen replied, \u201cYour ordinary mind is the Tao.\u201d \u201cHow,\u201d asked Joshu, \u201ccan one return into accord with it?\u201d Nansen answered, \u201cBy intending to accord you immediately deviate.\u201d"

For the distinction of the voluntary and the involuntary is valid only within a somewhat limited perspective. Strictly speaking, I will or decide involuntarily.

When, therefore, it is understood that these ego-environment and voluntary-involuntary distinctions are conventional, and valid only within limited and somewhat arbitrary perspectives, we find ourselves in a kind of experiencing to which such expressions as \u201cOne is All and All is One\u201d are quite appropriate."

        "output": "In short, Zen is also a liberation from the dualism of thought versus action, for it thinks as it acts\u2014with the same quality of abandon, commitment, or faith. Thus the attitude of mushin is by no means an anti-intellectualist exclusion of thinking. It is action upon any level whatsoever, physical or psychic, without trying at the same moment to observe and check the action from outside, that is, without wobbling or anxiety."

Both the external world of material events and the internal world of thought and feeling are realms which the self confronts as alien to and other than itself. The individual therefore experiences himself as something in, but not truly of, a universe which cares nothing for him, and in which he is a very impermanent fluke."

He is, as it were, thrown into sunyata like a person falling, for the first time, into water, into the ocean of relativity.

The term \u201cprayer of quiet\u201d refers to the quiescence of the sensations, thoughts and feelings, but the term \u201csimple regard\u201d refers to an intense activity in that center of consciousness, which underlies these three faculties."

To know God by unknowing is to surrender the mind entirely to God instead of trying to possess God as a concept of the mind or an object of knowledge. The mind knows God by unknowing in the same way that the soul is saved by losing itself. To abandon the mind to the Void of the \u201cdivine darkness\u201d in the loving faith that God is there is the equivalent of abandoning the body to a sacrificial death in the full faith that God is beyond the darkness of the grave. In either case, the very act is accompanied by a mysterious sense of the peace and joy of God, which is why the darkness of unknowing is described as full of light."

        "output": "Created light or truth is the polar opposite of creaturely darkness or falsehood, but God does not stand in relation to darkness and falsehood as its polar opposite, for this would degrade Him to equality with them. The goodness of God is therefore in no dualistic or mutually interdependent relationship with evil, as is purely human goodness. Our created minds cannot grasp the mystery of evil because they cannot rise above dualism and conceive an order of goodness, which is definitively not evil and yet is not the equal and opposite of evil. Because purely human goodness is the equal and opposite of evil, it can have no final victory over it. But God has final victory over evil because He is not in a dualistic relation to it. Evil is creaturely, and the dualistic relation can be between one creature and another, but not between Creator and creature."

His guilt is not demonstrated beyond all possible doubt because his crime was not seen. There is a remote chance that someone else committed it.

The fourth proof adds to this that God is not mere being; he does not simply exist like a stone, or a man after a heavy dinner.

Its essence is that Holy Matrimony is constituted by two baptized persons entering into the marriage contract and living together as man and wife. Because they are baptized they are one with Christ and partakers of the divine nature and the divine love. Thus the love that they have for one another must be a degree of agape, God\u2019s own love, for which reason their union is analogous to the union of God and the world in Christ. Such is the basic principle upon which the whole structure of the doctrine depends."

Only God, being infinite, can give himself wholly to many objects. It is permanent, \u201ctil death do us part,\u201d because to give oneself wholly in love means that you give not only what you are now, but also what you will be; you give your whole life, both as it expands in space and in time."

Eros is self-love; it is the love of the sensation, the emotion within oneself that another person arouses. In essence, natural love is to be in love with the state of being in love.

The keynote of Christian marriage is therefore wholeness, which is after all the same word as holiness. It is the product of a love in which the lover gives himself wholly to all of the beloved, not a mind, not a soul, not just a woman in the abstract, but that totality of aspects and qualities that adds up to a unique human being."

A Christian is one who tries to do every single daily action for the glory of God, turning his whole life into an act of worship. Sexuality must not be excluded from this worship, for as much as anything else it is done in the eyes of God and will become evil unless dedicated to him."

The natural idea of sexual pleasure is the reverse\u2014\u201cwith thy body I me worship\u201d\u2014and when this is the motive the act will not be sexual communion at all, but simply self-gratification. To overcome this he must have a degree of genuine altruism found only in agape-love. Similar haste and selfishness on the part of the woman, though more rare, will have the same effect."

It lacks analogy with God the Creator. Since, too, the sexual act is always liable to produce children, it cannot be entered into with the necessary relaxation and self-abandonment if there is any anxiety as to its results. Only the security of permanent marriage can fully get rid of anxiety and its attendant frustration of pleasure."

People can react to such frustration in one of two ways: they can go on practicing and loving until perfection is reached, or they can retire into the realm of fantasy, and simply dream about an easy and readymade perfection. The latter course opens the door to every kind of sexual evil, because these fantasies soon grow to the point where pleasures are imagined that reality can never provide."

Perhaps this is a bold statement, but the evidence is that wherever these principles are not followed, an atmosphere of obsession prevails upon the subject of sex, which is a clear sign of frustration. As St. Thomas insisted over and over again, the principles of the spiritual life do not destroy nature: they perfect it."

        "output": "It is a truism that one must marry even more for companionship than for physical attraction, but sometimes I think a truism may be defined as a principle that all know and few observe. So few young people seem to realize that the real work of marriage is to learn to live in the same house, in the same room, with another person day after day, year after year, on terms of such great intimacy. Because of this, the adjustment of sexuality is far less difficult than the adjustment, the union, of tastes, interests, minds, and characters."

He took the bread and broke it and said, \u201cThis is my body.\u201d Then he took the cup and said, \u201cThis is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you and for many for the remission of sins.

We are killing something, whether it be vegetables, cows, chickens, turkeys, or whatnot. We are all killing something in order to live. Each one of us, deep down in his heart, has probably a profound sense of guilt for living only at the expense of other life. So when Jesus said \u201cThis is my blood which is shed for you for the remission (the putting away) of sins,\u201d it means this: Don\u2019t feel guilty anymore that you have to drink the grapes and eat the crushed wheat, because all that you eat is me, and I\u2019m offering myself to you and it is my pleasure."

Thus, for example, when Benedictine monks recite the psalms in what they call the Divine Office, they have the idea that the words of the song are the words of the Holy Spirit, not their own personal words. When they sing the songs, the Holy Spirit is talking through their mouths. All worship thus originates in God and returns to God."

There is a sense of somehow not belonging. Of course, if you are a fluke, in that sense you don\u2019t belong. Likewise, if you are an incarcerated spirit from a spiritual world quite other than this material world, you don\u2019t belong. There is in most civilized people\u2019s common sense the feeling that you look upon this world as something outside you, foreign to you, alien to you."

You are symptomatic of this world. Thus, if you are intelligent (and I guess we just have to assume as a leap of faith that human beings are intelligent) you are symptomatic of an intelligent energy system, just as Jesus said that one doesn\u2019t gather figs from thistles or grapes from thorns. So also you don\u2019t gather people from a world that isn\u2019t peopling. Our world is peopling just as the apple tree apples, and just as the vine grapes."

        "output": "One of the major roots of tension and paranoia in the United States today is the conflict between religion and politics. It has a fascinating history, which is largely a religious history. Most citizens of the United States who claim to be religious are either Christians or Jews, inheriting a form of religion that is based on a monarchical model of the universe. But the nation itself is a republic, ideally and theoretically democratic, having philosophical origins in an outburst of mysticism that occurred in Western Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, associated with such individuals as Meister Eckhart, John of Ruysbroek, Angelus Silesius, and Richard Tauler, and with such movements as the Anabaptists, the Brothers of the Free Spirit, the Levellers, and the Quakers, which arose in the three centuries following as a consequence of this mystical outburst."

It realizes and implements the views that all men are equal in the sight of God, or rather, at the level of their inmost divinity. From such insights and stirrings as these, as well as from economic pressures, hundreds and then thousands left the feudal and monarchical order of Europe, came to this country, and eventually established a republic as their form of government."

Jews, Catholics, and Fundamentalist Protestants believe emphatically that God is the heavenly king and father who must above all be obeyed. However, is it possible to be religious, to have faith in God, without believing that the universe is a monarchy? Does the idea of God necessarily imply the principle of monarchy at the base of the universe?"

This would generally be true for the Hindu, and most definitely for the Buddhist and Taoist. The Hindu does not see God as ruling the universe as a king imposes order by force on inferior subjects. He sees God, not as ruling, but as acting the world as a drama in which he is the player of all the parts, so that the whole multiplicity of individual beings are not his subjects but his roles and masks (personae)."

For we are being brought up under the sway of two mutually inconsistent philosophies. On the one hand, we are told that we must be responsible, and that it\u2019s up to us, as independent citizens in equality with all others, to assume responsibility for the government of our country. On the other hand, instead of doing just that, we are also looking over our shoulders for support and authority from tradition, law, and monarchical order deriving from the father and the past."

It is a social institution, or a convention, but it is not an effective agent, an effective energy, and that\u2019s why you can't do anything about it. Let\u2019s analyze this ego, therefore, and see what it is. First of all, it arises from a fundamental human confusion between the world of real events and the world as described. The first step is language, and it is typical of all civilized and even many uncivilized peoples that they confuse words with realities, just as we confuse wealth with money, and status with happiness.

        "output": "A proper study of the question runs, at the very beginning, into two obstacles. The first is that we know very little indeed about the structure and chemistry of the brain. We do not know enough of the ways in which it gleans information about the outside world and about itself to know whether these chemicals help it (as lenses help the eyes) or confuse it."

        "input": "How do different experiences change depending on personal and environmental factors?",
        "output": "What we know, positively and scientifically, about psychedelic chemicals is that they bring about certain alterations of sense perception, of emotional level and tone, of identity feeling, of the interpretation of sense data, and of the sensations of time and space. The nature of these alterations depends on three variables: the chemical itself (type and dosage), the psycho-physiological state of the subject, and the social and aesthetic context of the experiment. Their physiological side effects are minimal, though there are conditions (e.g., disease of the liver) in which some of them may be harmful."

But this applies equally to antibiotics, whisky, household ammonia, the automobile, the kitchen knife, electricity, and matches. No worthwhile life can be lived without risks. The question is therefore whether the risks involved in using these chemicals are worthwhile, and it seems to me that what is worthwhile should be judged not only in terms of useful knowledge or therapeutic effect but also in terms of simple pleasure."

This is the vivid realization that states, things, and events that we ordinarily call opposite are interdependent, like back and front or the poles of a magnet. By polar awareness one sees that things that are explicitly different are implicitly one: self and other, subject and object, left and right, male and female\u2014and then, a little more surprisingly, solid and space, figure and background, pulse and interval, saints and sinners, and police and criminals, ingroups and outgroups.

        "output": "It has perhaps never occurred to Christians that when they design a church on the model of a royal court (basilica) and prescribe church ritual, they are implying that God, like a human monarch, is afraid. This is also implied by flattery in prayers: O Lord our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost from thy throne behold all the dwellers upon earth: most heartily we beseech thee with thy favor to behold..."

In most Asian cultures, however, such a man will be congratulated as having penetrated the true secret of life. He has arrived, by chance or by some such discipline as Yoga or Zen meditation, at a state of consciousness in which he experiences directly and vividly what our own scientists know to be true in theory."

        "output": "The kingly concept of God makes identity of self and God, or self and universe, inconceivable in Western religious terms. The difference between Eastern and Western concepts of man and universe, however, extends beyond strictly religious concepts. The Western scientist may rationally perceive the idea of organism-environment, but he does not ordinarily feel this to be true. By cultural and social conditioning, he has been hypnotized into experiencing himself as an ego\u2014as an isolated center of consciousness and will inside a bag of skin, confronting an external and alien world."

The result is that we are eroding and destroying our environment, spreading Los Angelization instead of civilization. "

        "output": "From the outset, there is one notable difference between the \u201cpsycho- therapy,\u201d the transformation of the mind, envisaged by an Oriental psychology, on the one hand, and Western psychiatry, on the other. In the West we are chiefly preoccupied with the transformation of mental states that are peculiar to relatively few individuals, and that arise out of certain special conditioning circumstances of the individual\u2019s history. But Asian psychology interests itself in the transformation of states that are common to mankind as a whole, and is thus, as it were, a psychotherapy of the \u201cnormal\u201d man. It proposes to change patterns of thought and feeling that are characteristic of the society as well as of the individual, though this does not amount in practice to an attempt to change the society as a whole.

        "output": "For it is recognized that in any given society relatively few individuals seem to have the capacity and the interest to liberate themselves from patterns of conditioning common to all. It follows that for an Oriental psychology, \u201cnormalcy\u201d could never be a standard of mental health\u2014where \u201cnormalcy\u201d means the ways of thinking and feeling, the conventions and life-goals, acceptable to the majority of persons in a particular culture. Likewise, the diseases of the mind are not recognized in terms of deviation from the normal. From this (Oriental) standpoint, there is a clear absurdity in trying to achieve the \u201chappy adjustment\u201d of an individual to the conventions of a society that is largely composed of unhappy people.

        "output": "Thus an Oriental psychology such as Buddhism is concerned, not with the peculiar frustrations of the neurotic individual, but with the general frustra- tion, the common unhappiness (duhkha in Sanskrit), which afflicts almost every member of the society. Buddhist and Hindu psychology agree in ascribing this general unhappiness to avidya\u2014the Sanskrit term for a special type of ignorance or unconscious- ness, which is the failure to perceive that certain desires and activities are self- contradictory and \u201cviciously circular.\u201d The victims of avidya are thus described as being in the state of samsara\u2014the \u201cround\u201d or \u201cwhirl\u201d\u2014a life pattern that, having set itself a self-contradictory goal, revolves or oscillates interminably to the increasing discomfiture of those involved.

        "output": "Self-contradiction is technically described in Buddhist and Hindu psychol- ogy as the human mind in a state of dvaita, which is duality or dividedness, a concept rather more inclusive than the approximate Western equivalent of \u201cinternal conflict.\u201d One of the simplest examples of dvaita and its attendant self-contradiction is the making of one\u2019s life-goal the acquisition of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. It is pointed out that pleasure and pain are relative experiences, such that a life consisting wholly or even principally of pleasure is as far beyond any possibility of experience as a world in which \u201ceverything is up\u201d and nothing down. To the degree that one avoids pain one also eliminates pleasure, and so achieves a way of life that is merely indifferent and boring. "

        "output": "Consequently a life devoted to the pursuit of pleasure or happiness is devoted to a self-contradictory goal, because, in so far as one succeeds in gaining pleasure, there is necessarily a proportionate increase in some form of pain\u2014often the simple, but most unpleasant, anxiety of losing what one has gained. Buddhist psychology, in particular, emphasizes as perhaps the major form of self-contradiction a division of experience into subject and object, thinker and thought, feeler and feeling. According to Buddhist psychology, the notion that \u201cI\u201d am in some way different from the feelings that I now feel or the thought that I now think, the notion that man\u2019s psycho-organism contains an ego as the enduring subject of a changing panorama of sensations, is an illusion based on memory (smrti)."

According to our system of typical symbols, the spotlight, being a pinpoint sort of thing, will be male, and the floodlight, being diffused, will be female.

Here was this tough old sea captain entertaining at dinner, dressed in lavish silks, with gold plate on the table and a trio with violins and flutes. As a parting gift Sir Francis presented the Spaniard with several bottles of fine perfume."

Thirdly, the individual is more valued than the individual\u2019s own extended body, which is his whole natural environment.

Now this has great advantages, but its disadvantage is that one confuses the world as symbolized with the world that is. You can\u2019t confuse the map with the territory, the menu with the meal. We have to get back to a direct relationship with the physical world. Even when one says \u201cphysical world,\u201d that is a concept. Physical is an Aristotelian idea about the nature of things.

The philosophy of nature of the nineteenth century has become the common sense of the twentieth century, and is widely accepted in the medical profession, in the psychotherapeutic professions, and in sociology. From the point of view of a physicist or an advanced mathematician or biologist, however, there is a serious question as to whether psychiatry is a genuine science, and even whether medicine is a genuine science. These professions have not caught up with quantum theory and are still holding Newtonian views of the universe, thinking about their subjects in terms of mechanical models."

Within limits, something can be achieved: right and wrong can be laid down; success and failure can be determined; important and unimportant can be distinguished. By constructing a frame whose boundaries are birth and death, we can, within those limits, live out a life that appears to be meaningful and to accomplish something in terms of time. But a strange disquiet arises when we look outside the frame, for before birth we are not, and after death we leave only brief memorials."

The inconsistency is not so much intellectual as aesthetic, for what I feel is an incompatibility of character, of style. No one, for example, would dream of attributing a landscape by Sesshu to Constable or C\u00e9zanne, or a symphony by Haydn to Schoenberg or Palestrina. In the same way, my feeling for the style of Christianity, whether Catholic or Protestant, makes it completely impossible for me to identify the author of this religion with the author of the physical universe.

This is why you connect Christianity with the urban rather than the rural atmosphere, because in the urban atmosphere you are surrounded by the works of humanity. Tt is true that in a rural environment you are surrounded by the works of God. But humanity, and even the creations of humanity, are far higher works of God than anything you can find elsewhere in nature. Thus they reveal more of the character of God than the sun, moon, and stars, the clouds and the waters, for what we sometimes call the artificial is nearer to the supernatural than the natural."

Now it is true that we often want to seek relief from the hideousness of crowds and cities in the solitude of nature, but this is only because the worst is the corruption of the best. The evil of humanity is far more terrible than the evil of the serpent or the shark, but only because the goodness of humanity immeasurably exceeds the goodness of a spring landscape. You have only to consider how utterly lonely and lost you would feel if you were the only human being in the world. How glad you would then be to exchange the whole sum of natural beauty for a single human face."

On the other hand, what we call our ego is something abstract. It has the same order and kind of reality as an hour or an inch or a pound or a line of longitude. It exists for purposes of discussion, for convenience. The possession of an ego is a social convention; the fallacy that all of us succumb to is treating it as if it were a physical organism, as if the ego were real in that sense, when in fact it is no more than our image of ourselves."

Yet, nearly 45 years after his 1973 passing, interest in Watts\u2019 life and work is not subsiding. His books remain in vogue, and popular audiences in large numbers now view his audiovisual materials via YouTube. Moreover, contemporary scholars are currently mapping Watts\u2019 historical influence, and surveying his ongoing impact in a variety of academic disciplines."

Throughout his life Watts had rather tumultuous relationships with formal institutions of learning.

Some theologically occidental examiner must have been offended\u201d (p. 118); (3) the advice of Marguerite Block, editor of the Review of Religion, who in 1940 counseled against Watts pursuing doctoral studies: \u201cShe said . . . it isn\u2019t worth it. I simply wouldn\u2019t waste your time with all that picayune, myopic-minded, long-drawn-out, mole-eyed academic ritual\u201d (p. 175); (4) his abrupt resignations from Northwestern University and the Episcopal Church in 1950: \u201cI chose the priesthood because it was the only formal role of Western society into which, at the time, I could even begin to fit... . But it was an ill-fitting suit of clothes\u201d (p. 214); and (5) his 1957 resignation from the American Academy of Asian Studies where, as he later wrote, \u201cI was as much out of place in the groves of academe as in the Church, . . . I was never, never going to be an organization man\u201d (pp. 319-320)."
