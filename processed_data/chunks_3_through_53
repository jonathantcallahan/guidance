In the years after his death, and due much to his popularity among wide-ranging audiences, Watts was mostly marginalized by those in higher education."

Two components of the debate are relevant here. First is the problem of religious language, that is to say, the extent to which human linguistic forms limit, afford, or nullify veridical claims about God and mystical transcendence (Reed, 2007; White, 2010).

Second is the view that Watts arrogated Buddhism and constructed a philosophical commodity for consumption by an American constituency alienated from Cold War politics. Third is that Watts was signaling an Occidentalism, converting extant Japanese appraisals of American rationalism and materialism into therapeutic critiques of Cold War culture in America. Finally, Watts is seen as proffering a \u201cmodern Buddhism\u201d that is divergent from tradition, but congruent with the spiritual sensibilities of contemporary Western life."

For all these philosophies it is a first principle that the seeming separateness of the ego from the world, so that it could be its controller, is an illusion.

This knowledge consists, not in a verbal proposition, but in a psychological change, similar to that which occurs in the cure of a psychosis. One in whom this change has come to pass does not attempt to control the world, or himself, by the efforts of his own will. He learns the art of \u201cletting things happen,\u201d which is no mere passivity but, on the contrary, a creative technique familiar to the activity of many artists, musicians, and inventers in our own culture, whereby skill and insight are found to be the fruits of a certain \u201cdynamic relaxation.\u201d"

For in the philosophy attributed to Gautama by the earliest records no place is given to a God or gods who can assist man in the development of spiritual life; the existence of such divine beings is not denied\u2014it is ignored on the ground that no power on earth or in heaven can interfere with another\u2019s karma.

If any faith was involved, it was faith in one\u2019s own capacity to work out one\u2019s own salvation, and faith in the ability of Buddhism to supply the necessary method. In the Hinayana system the method was to exhaust the process of karma by perceiving the fundamental unreality of the individual (atta) who sets karma in motion."

        "output": "Generally speaking, the Buddhism of faith is founded upon the Sukhavativyuha Sutra which, so far as we know, was compiled some three hundred years after Gautama\u2019s death. The Sukhavativyuha tells of one Dharmakara, who, in some immeasurably distant age, made forty-eight vows concerning the liberation of sentient beings. Before making these vows he had devoted himself, for an equally incomprehensible span of time, to innumerable good works, thus acquiring for himself a store of merit sufficient to give abundant aid to the whole world."

From then on he was known as the Buddha Amitabha (Boundless Light) or Amitayus (Eternal Life). The Chinese form of the name is O-mi-to-fo, and the Japanese is Amida, by which he is most generally known. "

Thus, in the seventh chapter of his Epistle to the Romans St. Paul writes, \u201cNay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.\u201d"

Birth in the Pure Land was no longer a question of directing one\u2019s own store of merit toward Amida\u2014as a strictly accurate reading of the Sukhavativyuha would indicate. Shinran turned the sense of the words, making birth in the Pure Land dependent on Amida\u2019s turning his store of merit towards the individual. "
