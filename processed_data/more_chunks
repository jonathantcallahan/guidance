        "output": "The mind of man makes sense out of life by looking at it through frames. Within limits, something can be achieved: right and wrong can be laid down; success and failure can be determined; important and unimportant can be distinguished. By constructing a frame whose boundaries are birth and death, we can, within those limits, live out a life that appears to be meaningful and to accomplish something in terms of time. But a strange disquiet arises when we look outside the frame, for before birth we are not, and after death we leave only brief memorials."

What \u201cis\u201d is defined by the frame that distinguishes it from what is not, and vice versa. Motion is defined by the frame that separates it from stillness, so that if the frame be removed and we find ourselves in a world where all is in motion, the idea of motion ceases to mean anything. This is why the logicians say that there cannot be a class of all classes, a frame including all frames\u2014for a frame with nothing at all outside its edges would not be a frame. It would be as inconceivable as the color of the eyeball\u2019s lens."

The inconsistency is not so much intellectual as aesthetic, for what I feel is an incompatibility of character, of style. No one, for example, would dream of attributing a landscape by Sesshu to Constable or C\u00e9zanne, or a symphony by Haydn to Schoenberg or Palestrina. In the same way, my feeling for the style of Christianity, whether Catholic or Protestant, makes it completely impossible for me to identify the author of this religion with the author of the physical universe.

This is why you connect Christianity with the urban rather than the rural atmosphere, because in the urban atmosphere you are surrounded by the works of humanity. Tt is true that in a rural environment you are surrounded by the works of God. But humanity, and even the creations of humanity, are far higher works of God than anything you can find elsewhere in nature. Thus they reveal more of the character of God than the sun, moon, and stars, the clouds and the waters, for what we sometimes call the artificial is nearer to the supernatural than the natural."

Now it is true that we often want to seek relief from the hideousness of crowds and cities in the solitude of nature, but this is only because the worst is the corruption of the best. The evil of humanity is far more terrible than the evil of the serpent or the shark, but only because the goodness of humanity immeasurably exceeds the goodness of a spring landscape. You have only to consider how utterly lonely and lost you would feel if you were the only human being in the world. How glad you would then be to exchange the whole sum of natural beauty for a single human face."

On the other hand, what we call our ego is something abstract. It has the same order and kind of reality as an hour or an inch or a pound or a line of longitude. It exists for purposes of discussion, for convenience. The possession of an ego is a social convention; the fallacy that all of us succumb to is treating it as if it were a physical organism, as if the ego were real in that sense, when in fact it is no more than our image of ourselves."

Yet, nearly 45 years after his 1973 passing, interest in Watts\u2019 life and work is not subsiding. His books remain in vogue, and popular audiences in large numbers now view his audiovisual materials via YouTube. Moreover, contemporary scholars are currently mapping Watts\u2019 historical influence, and surveying his ongoing impact in a variety of academic disciplines."

Throughout his life Watts had rather tumultuous relationships with formal institutions of learning.

Some theologically occidental examiner must have been offended\u201d (p. 118); (3) the advice of Marguerite Block, editor of the Review of Religion, who in 1940 counseled against Watts pursuing doctoral studies: \u201cShe said . . . it isn\u2019t worth it. I simply wouldn\u2019t waste your time with all that picayune, myopic-minded, long-drawn-out, mole-eyed academic ritual\u201d (p. 175); (4) his abrupt resignations from Northwestern University and the Episcopal Church in 1950: \u201cI chose the priesthood because it was the only formal role of Western society into which, at the time, I could even begin to fit... . But it was an ill-fitting suit of clothes\u201d (p. 214); and (5) his 1957 resignation from the American Academy of Asian Studies where, as he later wrote, \u201cI was as much out of place in the groves of academe as in the Church, . . . I was never, never going to be an organization man\u201d (pp. 319-320)."
